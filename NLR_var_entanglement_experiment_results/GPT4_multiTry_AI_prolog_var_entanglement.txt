% The initial state of the plate is encoded as a list of 4 elements, each element is a pair of the color of the subsquare and the number of designs on it
% The order of the elements in the list represents the position of the subsquares on the plate, starting from the top left subsquare and moving clockwise
% The flip operation is encoded as a predicate that swaps the positions of the top right and bottom left subsquares


% flip_plate encodes the flip operation on the plate
flip_plate(Plate, Flipped_plate):-
% The plate is a list of 4 elements, each element is a pair of the color of the subsquare and the number of designs on it
Plate = [Top_left, Top_right, Bottom_right, Bottom_left],
% The flip operation swaps the positions of the top right and bottom left subsquares
Flipped_plate = [Top_left, Bottom_left, Bottom_right, Top_right].


% add_designs encodes the addition of designs to the subsquares
% The position of the subsquares to add designs to is given as a list of indices

% Getting the index of the first subsquare to add designs to
Indices = [Index|Rest_indices],
% Using nth0 to get the color and number of designs on the subsquare at the given index
nth0(Index, Plate, [Color, Num_designs_prev]),

problem(Difference_designs):-
% Encoding the initial state of the plate
% The plate is a square metal plate divided into four equal subsquares, each colored differently
% The plate is oriented such that the top left subsquare is red, and moving clockwise, the subsquares are blue, orange, and purple
% Initially there are no designs on any of the subsquares
Initial_plate = [['red', 0], ['blue', 0], ['orange', 0], ['purple', 0]],


% The artist begins by flipping the square
flip_plate(Initial_plate, Plate_after_flip1),


% Then he adds three designs to the top right subsquare and two to the bottom left subsquare
% The top right subsquare is at index 1 and the bottom left one is at index 3
add_designs(Plate_after_flip1, [1], 3, Plate_after_adding1),
add_designs(Plate_after_adding1, [3], 2, Plate_after_adding2),


% Next, he flips the plate again
flip_plate(Plate_after_adding2, Plate_after_flip2),


% And adds five designs to the 2 subsquares on the right side of the plate
% The subsquares on the right side of the plate are at indices 1 and 2
add_designs(Plate_after_flip2, [1, 2], 5, Plate_after_adding3),


% He then flips the plate around in the same way
flip_plate(Plate_after_adding3, Plate_after_flip3),


% And adds four designs to each of the two subsquares at the bottom
% The subsquares at the bottom of the plate are at indices 2 and 3
add_designs(Plate_after_flip3, [2, 3], 4, Plate_after_adding4),


% To find the total number of designs on the red and blue subsquares subtracted from the total number of designs on the orange and purple subsquares
% We first need to find the number of designs on each colored subsquare
% Using member to find the pair of the color and number of designs for each colored subsquare
member(['red', Num_designs_red], Plate_after_adding4),
member(['blue', Num_designs_blue], Plate_after_adding4),
member(['orange', Num_designs_orange], Plate_after_adding4),
member(['purple', Num_designs_purple], Plate_after_adding4),


% Then we calculate the total number of designs on the red and blue subsquares and the total number of designs on the orange and purple subsquares
Total_designs_red_blue is Num_designs_red + Num_designs_blue,
Total_designs_orange_purple is Num_designs_orange + Num_designs_purple,


% Finally we subtract the total number of designs on the red and blue subsquares from the total number of designs on the orange and purple subsquares
Difference_designs is Total_designs_orange_purple - Total_designs_red_blue.
