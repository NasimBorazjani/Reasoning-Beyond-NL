Let's solve this step by step:

The initial square numbers are 1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0.

The waitlist numbers are 4, 3, 1, -1, -2, 1, 4.

Round 1: The waitlist number is 4. The target square is the first 0, which is the fourth square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 3 + 4 = 7, which does not equal the waitlist number. The number before the target square is 3, which also does not equal the waitlist number. So, the round ends with the waitlist number replacing the 0 in the target square. The squares now look like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0.

Round 2: The waitlist number is 3. The target square is the sixth square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 4 + -1 = 3, which equals the waitlist number. So, the numbers in all three squares become zero. The squares now look like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0.

Round 3: The waitlist number is 1. The target square is the fifth square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 4 + 0 = 4, which does not equal the waitlist number.

The squares now look like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0.

Round 4: The waitlist number is -1. The target square is the sixth square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 1 + 0 = 1, which does not equal the waitlist number. The number before the target square is 1, which also does not equal the waitlist number. So, the round ends with the waitlist number replacing the 0 in the target square. The squares now look like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, -1, 0, -1, 0, 0.

Round 5: The waitlist number is -2. The target square is the seventh square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is -1 + -1 = -2, which equals the waitlist number. So, the numbers in all three squares become zero. The squares now look like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

Round 6: The waitlist number is 1. The target square is the sixth square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 1 + 0 = 1, which equals the waitlist number. So, the numbers in all three squares become zero. The squares now look like this: 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

Round 7: The waitlist number is 4. The target square is the fourth square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 3 + 0 = 3, which does not equal the waitlist number.

After the waitlist is empty, the sum of the numbers in the 10 squares is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 10.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Sarah starts with a chain of 5 magnetic beads, with the middle bead being the only one with a scratch. Let's represent the chain as follows: 1-2-S-4-5, where 'S' is the scratched bead.

2. In the first round, Sarah rolls a 2. She disconnects the magnetic beads before the 2nd index, resulting in two segments: 1 and 2-S-4-5. She adds a total of 4 beads to the two segments, resulting in: 1-6 and 7-2-S-4-5-8. She then reverses the order of the two resulting segments before reconnecting them into a single chain: 7-2-S-4-5-8-1-6.

3. In the second round, Sarah rolls a 2 again. She disconnects the magnetic beads before the 2nd index, resulting in two segments: 7 and 2-S-4-5-8-1-6.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Swipe left at index 0: This targets the numbers at index 0 and -1. Since there is no index -1, only the number at index 0 is affected. The list becomes 1, 0, 9, 9, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

2. Swipe right at index 1: This targets the numbers at index 1 and 2. The numbers 0 and 9 are not equal, not both odd, and not both even, so they do not merge. The list remains 1, 0, 9, 9, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

3. Swipe right at index 7: This targets the numbers at index 7 and 8. The numbers 0 and 8 are both even, so they merge and are replaced with 0. The list becomes 1, 0, 9, 9, 3, 3, 8, 0, 5.

4. Swipe right at index 4: This targets the numbers at index 4 and 5. The numbers 3 and 3 are equal, so they merge and are replaced with 0. The list becomes 1, 0, 9, 9, 0, 8, 0, 5.

5. Swipe left at index 3: This targets the numbers at index 3 and 2. The numbers 9 and 9 are equal, so they merge and are replaced with 1. The list becomes 1, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 5.

The final list length is 7 and the sum of its numbers is 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 5 = 15.

So, the final list length plus the sum of its numbers is 7 + 15 = 22.

1. Swipe left at index 4: This targets 9 (index 4) and 3 (index 3). They are both odd, so they merge to (9+3)%10 = 2. The list becomes: 2, 0, 2, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

2. Swipe right at index 5: This targets 3 (index 5) and 8 (index 6). They don't meet any merging conditions, so a 0 is added between them. The list becomes: 2, 0, 2, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

3. Swipe left at index 4: This targets 3 (index 4) and 0 (index 3). They don't meet any merging conditions, so a 0 is added between them. The list becomes: 2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

4. Swipe right at index 6: This targets 3 (index 6) and 8 (index 7). They don't meet any merging conditions, so a 0 is added between them. The list becomes: 2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

5. Swipe right at index 3: This targets 0 (index 3) and 3 (index 4). They don't meet any merging conditions, so a 0 is added between them. The list becomes: 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

6. Swipe right at index 4: This targets 0 (index 4) and 3 (index 5). They don't meet any merging conditions, so a 0 is added between them. The list becomes: 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

The final list length is 14 and the sum of its numbers is 2+0+2+0+0+0+3+0+0+3+8+0+8+5 = 31.

So, the final list length plus the sum of its numbers is 14 + 31 = 45.

The answer is /boxed/45.

Let's solve this step by step:

The initial list is: 2, 0, 9, 9, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

1. Swipe left at index 4: This targets 9 and 3. Since they are not equal, not both odd, and not both even, the number at index 4 - 2 = 2 is added as a padding between them. The list becomes: 2, 0, 9, 9, 2, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

2. Swipe right at index 5: This targets 2 and 3. Since they are not equal, not both odd, and not both even, the number at index 5 - 2 = 3 is added as a padding between them. The list becomes: 2, 0, 9, 9, 2, 3, 2, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

3. Swipe left at index 4: This targets 2 and 3. Since they are not equal, not both odd, and not both even, the number at index 4 - 2 = 2 is added as a padding between them. The list becomes: 2, 0, 9, 9, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5.

4. Swipe right at index 6: This targets 3 and 3. Since they are equal, they merge to become (3 + 3) modulo 10 = 6. The list becomes: 2, 0, 9, 9, 2, 2, 6, 8, 0, 8, 5.

5. Swipe right at index 3: This targets 9 and 2. Since they are not equal, not both odd, and not both even, the number at index 3 - 2 = 1 is added as a padding between them. The list becomes: 2, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 6, 8, 0, 8, 5.

6. Swipe right at index 4: This targets 0 and 2. Since they are both even, they merge to become (0 + 2) modulo 10 = 2. The list becomes: 2, 0, 9, 9, 2, 2, 6, 8, 0, 8, 5.

The final list length is 11 and the sum of its numbers is 2 + 0 + 9 + 9 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 8 + 0 + 8 + 5 = 51.

So, the final list length plus the sum of its numbers is 11 + 51 = 62.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. The initial length of the top edge of the fabric is 5m.

2. After the first stretch, the length of the top edge is increased by 10%. So, the new length is 5m * 1.10 = 5.5m.

3. After the second stretch, the length of the top edge is again increased by 10%. So, the new length is 5.5m * 1.10 = 6.05m.

4. After the third stretch, the length of the top edge is again increased by 10%. So, the new length is 6.05m * 1.10 = 6.655m.

5. After the fourth stretch, the length of the top edge is again increased by 10%. So, the new length is 6.655m * 1.10 = 7.3205m.

', 'type': 'Algorithmic Instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'Number of entangled variables in each state': 2, 'ID of problem in NLR dataset': None, 'answer': 0.62}
Let's solve this step by step:

1. The scientist starts with a square fabric with a side length of 5m. So, both the top and bottom edges are 5m long.

2. He stretches the top edge by 5%. So, the top edge becomes 5m * 1.05 = 5.25m long.

3. He stretches the bottom edge by 10%. So, the bottom edge becomes 5m * 1.10 = 5.5m long.

4. He rotates the fabric 180 degrees. So, the top edge becomes the bottom edge and vice versa. Now, the top edge is 5.5m long and the bottom edge is 5.25m long.

5. He stretches the top edge by 5%. So, the top edge becomes 5.5m * 1.05 = 5.775m long.

6. He stretches the bottom edge by 10%. So, the bottom edge becomes 5.25m * 1.10 = 5.775m long.

7. He rotates the fabric 180 degrees again. So, the top edge becomes the bottom edge and vice versa. Now, the top edge is 5.775m long and the bottom edge is 5.775m long.

8. He stretches the top edge by 5%. So, the top edge becomes 5.775m * 1.05 = 6.06375m long.

9. He stretches the bottom edge by 10%. So, the bottom edge becomes 5.775m * 1.10 = 6.3525m long.

10. He stretches the top edge by 5% again. So, the top edge becomes 6.06375m * 1.05 = 6.3669375m long.

11. He stretches the bottom edge by 10% again. So, the bottom edge becomes 6.3525m * 1.10 = 6.98775m long.

The difference between the length of the edge at the top of the fabric and the edge at the bottom of the fabric after these actions is 6.98775m - 6.3669375m = 0.6208125m.

The answer is /boxed/0.6208125.
