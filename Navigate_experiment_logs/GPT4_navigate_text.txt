"Always face forward." - We are instructed to keep our orientation constant. 
"Take 6 steps forward." - We move 6 steps forward.
"Take 10 steps left." - We move 10 steps to the left. So now we are 6 steps forward and 10 steps to the left from our original position.
"Take 8 steps left." - We move 8 steps to the left. Now we are 6 steps forward and 18 steps to the left from our original position.
"Take 2 steps backward." - We move 2 steps backward. We are now 4 steps forward and 18 steps to the left from our original position.
"Take 4 steps backward." - We move 4 steps backward. So now we are 18 steps to the left and 2 steps backward from our original position.

Therefore, our final position is 18 steps to the left and 2 steps backward of the starting point. Using the pythagorean theorem we can calculate the distance, which is round(sqrt(18^2 + 2^2)) = 18. The answer is /boxed/18.

{'Instructions': 'Take 9 steps. Take 3 steps. Take 2 steps. Turn around.', 'Difficulty': 4, 'Answer': 0, 'Inst_type': 'turns', 'Distance': 14}
"Take 9 steps." - We move 9 steps forward.
"Take 3 steps." - We move 3 steps forward. So far, we’ve moved 12 steps forward in total.
"Take 2 steps." - We move 2 steps forward. We’ve moved 14 steps forward in total now.
"Turn around." - We turn around 180 degrees. Our direction is now opposite to the original direction. 

Since we don't take any steps after turning around, our final position is 14 steps forward from our starting position. Therefore, the distance of our final position relative to our starting position is 14. The answer is /boxed/14.

{'Instructions': 'Turn left. Take 7 steps. Turn around. Take 7 steps. Turn right. Turn around.', 'Difficulty': 6, 'Answer': 1, 'Inst_type': 'turns', 'Distance': 0}
"Turn left." - We turn left but don't move.
"Take 7 steps." - We move 7 steps to the left.
"Turn around." - We turn around 180 degrees. Our direction is now opposite to the original direction.
“Take 7 steps." - We move 7 steps in the opposite direction. Thus, now we’ve moved back to our original position.
“Turn right." - We turn right but don't move.
“Turn around." - We turn around 180 degrees. Our direction is now opposite to the original direction. But we don't move.

So, our final position is the same as our starting position. Therefore, the distance of our final position relative to our starting position is 0. The answer is /boxed/0.

{'Instructions': 'Always face forward. Take 4 steps forward. Take 5 steps right. Take 7 steps left.', 'Difficulty': 4, 'Answer': 0, 'Inst_type': 'face_forward', 'Distance': 4}
"Always face forward." - We are instructed to keep our orientation constant. 
"Take 4 steps forward." - We move 4 steps forward.
"Take 5 steps right." - We move 5 steps to the right. So now we are 4 steps forward and 5 steps to the right from our original position.
"Take 7 steps left." - We move 7 steps to the left. Thus, now we are 4 steps forward and 2 steps to the left from our original position.

Therefore, our final position is 4 steps forward and 2 steps to the left of the starting point. Using the pythagorean theorem we can calculate the distance, which is round(sqrt(4^2 + 2^2)) = 4. The answer is /boxed/4.
