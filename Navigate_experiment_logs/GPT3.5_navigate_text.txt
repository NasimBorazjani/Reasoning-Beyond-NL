{'Instructions': 'Always face forward. Take 5 steps right. Take 1 step backward.', 'Difficulty': 3, 'Answer': 0, 'Inst_type': 'face_forward', 'Distance': 5}
"Always face forward." - We are instructed to keep our orientation constant. 
"Take 5 steps right." - We move 5 steps to the right. 
"Take 1 step backward." - We move 1 step backward. 

Therefore, our final position is 4 steps to the right and 1 step backward from the starting point. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the distance, which is round(sqrt(4^2 + 1^2)) = 4. The answer is /boxed/4.

"Always face forward." - We are instructed to keep our orientation constant. 
"Take 1 step forward." - We move 1 step forward.
"Take 6 steps forward." - We move 6 steps forward. So now we’ve moved 7 steps forward from our original position.
"Take 5 steps forward." - We move 5 steps forward. We’ve moved 12 steps forward in total now.
"Take 9 steps forward." - We move 9 steps forward. We’ve moved 21 steps forward in total now.
"Take 4 steps left." - We move 4 steps to the left. Now we are 21 steps forward and 4 steps to the left from our original position.
"Take 10 steps forward." - We move 10 steps forward. So now we are 31 steps forward and 4 steps to the left from our original position.
"Take 6 steps forward." - We move 6 steps forward. We are now 37 steps forward and 4 steps to the left from our original position.

Therefore, our final position is 37 steps forward and 4 steps to the left from the starting point. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the distance, which is round(sqrt(37^2 + 4^2)) = 37. The answer is /boxed/37.
