problem(Book_B_height):-
% David has 2 rectangular books, book A and book B.
% Let's denote the height of book A as HA, the width of book A as WA, the height of book B as HB, and the width of book B as WB.
HA #= 12,
% The surface area of book A is 96cm^2
WA #> HB,
WA * HA #= 96,
% The surface area of book A is equal to the surface area of book B multiplied by 3
WA * HA #= WB * HB * 3,
% The length of the thread is equal to the height of book A plus the width of book A
HA + WA #= Thread_length,
% The length of the thread is equal to either the width of book A plus height of book B or height of book A plus width of book B
((WA + HB #= Thread_length); (HA + WB #= Thread_length)),
% We need to find the height of book B
Book_B_height #= HB.
