{'statement': 'Alex has invented a new type of resistors and is building a system using these resistors. The formula for total resistance when two resistors are connected in parallel is R_result = R1 + R2, and when they are connected in series, it is R_result = R1 - R2, where R1 is the first resistor from left to right. He has 4 resistors: R1, R2, R3, and R4. All resistors have a positive resistance measured in Ohms. The resistances of R1 and R2 are equal, the resistance of R4 is between 18 and 25 Ohms, and R3 has the highest resistance. Alex first connects R1 and R2 in parallel to create System 1. He then connects System 1 and R3 in parallel to form System 2.  He finally connects system 2 to the left of R4 in series to create system 3. The measured resistance of System 3 is 23 Ohms. Given that the resistance of R3 is 20 Ohms, what is the resistance of R1?', 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 11}
Let's denote the resistance of R1 as x, the resistance of R2 as x, the resistance of R3 as 20 Ohms, and the resistance of R4 as y.

1. R1 and R2 are connected in parallel, so the total resistance is R1 + R2 = 2x.
2. System 1 and R3 are connected in parallel, so the total resistance is 1 / (1 / 2x + 1 / 20) = 20 / (20 + 40/x).
3. System 2 and R4 are connected in series, so the total resistance is (20 / (20 + 40/x)) + y = 23.

Now, we can solve for y:

(20 / (20 + 40/x)) + y = 23
20 / (20 + 40/x) = 23 - y
20 = (23 - y)(20 + 40/x)
20 = 460 + 920/x - 20y - 40y/x
920/x - 40y/x = 460 - 20y
(920 - 40y)/x = 460 - 20y
920 - 40y = x(460 - 20y)
x = (920 - 40y) / (460 - 20y)

Given that y is between 18 and 25 Ohms, let's try y = 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25:

For y = 18: x = (920 - 40*18) / (460 - 20*18) = 760 / 100 = 7.6
For y = 19: x = (920 - 40*19) / (460 - 20*19) = 720 / 420 = 7.2
For y = 20: x = (920 - 40*20) / (460 - 20*20) = 680 / 380 = 6.8
For y = 21: x = (920 - 40*21) / (460 - 20*21) = 640 / 340 = 6.4
For y = 22: x = (920 - 40*22) / (460 - 20*22) = 600 / 300 = 6
For y = 23: x = (920 - 40*23) / (460 - 20*23) = 560 / 260 = 5.6
For y = 24: x = (920 - 40*24) / (460 - 20*24) = 520 / 220 = 5
For y = 25: x = (920 - 40*25) / (460 - 20*25) = 480 / 180 = 4

Therefore, the resistance of R1 is 6 Ohms.

The answer is /boxed/6.

The robot moves diagonally from its position, stopping at (1, 1), moving all blocks in its path. If the robot moves a total of 18 blocks, how many blocks were initially at position (4, 4)?', 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 4}
Let's solve this step by step:

1. The height of the stack at position (1, 1) is less than 10m.
2. The height of the stack at (1, 1) is twice the height of the stacks at positions (2, 1) and (2, 2).
3. There is at least one block at position (3, 3).
4. The height of the stack at position (4, 4) is twice the height of the stack at (3, 3).
5. The combined height of the stacks at positions (3, 3) and (4, 4) is less than the height at position (1, 1).
6. A robot moves diagonally from position (5, 5) to (1, 1), moving all blocks in its path.
7. The robot moves a total of 18 blocks.

Let's denote the height of the stack at (1, 1) as x. Then:
- The height of the stacks at (2, 1) and (2, 2) is x/2.
- The height of the stack at (3, 3) is y (at least 1 block).
- The height of the stack at (4, 4) is 2y.

From the conditions given, we can deduce that:
- x > 10
- x = 2*(x/2) = 2y
- x > y + 2y

From these conditions, we can find that x = 12 and y = 6.

Therefore, the number of blocks initially at position (4, 4) is 6.

The answer is /boxed/6.

If Y is an even number and X is twice Y, then what is X + Y + Z?', 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 25}
Let's solve this step by step:

1. The numbers in the first row are Z, 2, 5. Since the numbers must be in order, Z < 2 < 5. So, Z must be 1.

2. The numbers in the second row are 12, 9, Y. Since the numbers must be in order, 9 < Y < 12. Given that Y is an even number, Y can be 10.

3. The numbers in the third row are X, 12, 9. Since X is twice Y (X = 2Y), and Y is 10, X must be 20.

Now, we can calculate X + Y + Z:

X + Y + Z = 20 + 10 + 1 = 31

So, the answer is /boxed/31.

Also at least one of my digits is 4 times one of my other digits, and the difference between my 2 middle digits is more than 3. What number am I?', 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 9821}
Let's denote the 4-digit number as abcd, where a, b, c, and d are the digits from left to right.

From the given conditions:
1. The rightmost digit (d) is not divisible by 2. This means d is either 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.
2. The sum of the digits is 20. So, a + b + c + d = 20.
3. All digits are in strictly decreasing order. This means a > b > c > d.
4. At least one digit is 4 times another digit. This implies that a = 4b or b = 4c or c = 4d.
5. The difference between the 2 middle digits is more than 3. This means b - c > 3.

Let's start by finding possible values for d:
Since d is not divisible by 2, d can be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.

Now, let's find possible values for a, b, and c:
From the condition that at least one digit is 4 times another digit, we can see that a = 4b or b = 4c or c = 4d.
Since a > b > c > d, we can deduce that a = 4b and b = 4c are not possible. So, c = 4d.

Now, let's find possible values for a, b, and c based on the relationship c = 4d:
If d = 1, then c = 4, b = 16 (not possible), a = 64 (not possible).
If d = 3, then c = 12, b = 48, a = 60.
If d = 5, then c = 20, b = 80 (not possible), a = 100 (not possible).
If d = 7, then c = 28, b = 112 (not possible), a = 448 (not possible).
If d = 9, then c = 36 (not possible).

Therefore, the only valid solution is when d = 3, c = 12, b = 48, and a = 60.

So, the number is 6048.

The answer is /boxed/6048.

Each basket belongs to Alice, Bobby, Charlie, Denise, or Eliot, and no two people share the same basket. If Bobby wants to split his candies between 5 people, he would have 3 candies remaining. Eliot has less candies than Alice, and Alice has more candies than Denise. Charlie can’t split her candies equally between 4 people, and she has fewer candies than Eliot, but if she doubles the number of her candies then she would have more candies than Eliot. What would we get if we subtract the sum of the number of candies that Bobby and Charlie have from the sum of Eliot's and Alice’s candies?", 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 0}
Let's solve this step by step:

1. Bobby has 5 candies, and if he splits them between 5 people, he would have 3 candies remaining. This means Bobby has 5 mod 5 = 3 candies.

2. Eliot has less candies than Alice, and Alice has more candies than Denise. Since Alice has 8 candies, Eliot must have 5 candies.

3. Charlie can't split her candies equally between 4 people, and she has fewer candies than Eliot, but if she doubles the number of her candies then she would have more candies than Eliot. This means Charlie has 12 candies.

4. Now, let's find out who owns which basket:
   - Alice has 8 candies (basket X)
   - Bobby has 5 candies (basket Y)
   - Charlie has 12 candies (basket T)
   - Denise has 23 candies (basket Z)
   - Eliot has 5 candies (basket E)

5. The sum of Eliot's and Alice's candies is 8 + 5 = 13.
   The sum of Bobby's and Charlie's candies is 5 + 12 = 17.

6. Subtracting the sum of Bobby's and Charlie's candies from the sum of Eliot's and Alice's candies, we get:
   13 - 17 = -4

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Emma was born 2 days before Andy, so Emma's birthday is on the 13th and Andy's birthday is on the 15th.
2. Blake was born 2 days before Danny, so Blake's birthday is on the 11th and Danny's birthday is on the 13th.
3. Emma's birthday is before Blake's birthday, so Emma's birthday is on the 13th and Blake's birthday is on the 11th.
4. The number of days between Danny’s birthday and Conor’s birthday is less than the number of days between Blake’s and Conor’s birthday. Since Danny's birthday is on the 13th, Conor's birthday must be on the 14th.
5. Connor is born after Danny, so Connor's birthday is on the 14th.

Now, let's calculate Andy's birth date minus Blake’s birth date plus Conor’s birth date:

Andy's birth date = 15

Let's denote the width of book A as w and the height of book B as h.

From the problem, we know:

1. The height of book A is 12 cm.
2. The width of book A is longer than the height of book B.
3. The surface area of book A is 96 cm^2.
4. The surface area of book A is equal to the surface area of book B multiplied by 3.
5. The length of the thread is equal to the height of book A plus the width of book A.
6. The length of the thread is equal to either the width of book A plus height of book B or height of book A plus width of book B.

Let's start by finding the width of book A:

Since the surface area of book A is 96 cm^2 and the height is 12 cm, we can calculate the width using the formula for the surface area of a rectangle: 

Surface Area = Height x Width
96 = 12 x Width
Width = 96 / 12
Width = 8 cm

Now, let's find the surface area of book B:

Since the surface area of book A is equal to the surface area of book B multiplied by 3:
Surface Area of Book A = Surface Area of Book B x 3
96 = Surface Area of Book B x 3
Surface Area of Book B = 96 / 3
Surface Area of Book B = 32 cm^2

Now, let's find the height of book B:

Since the length of the thread is equal to either the width of book A plus height of book B or height of book A plus width of book B:
12 + 8 = h or 12 + w = h
20 = h or 20 = h

Since the width of book A is longer than the height of book B, the height of book B must be 20 cm.

Therefore, the length of Book B's height is /boxed/20.

{'statement': 'We have a 4x4 grid of numbers greater than 1 and less than 13. We know that the numbers in a row, column, and the two diagonals must be consecutive, meaning either first > second > third> fourth or first < second < third < fourth in each row, column or diagonal. Below is the current state of the board. If a grid is marked as X, then the number in that position is masked, and it’s our task to determine the number.\n\nX X 5 9\nX 4 8 X\n5 X 10 X\n6 8 X X\n\nWhat is the sum of all the numbers in the board after determining all the numbers in the X positions?', 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 114}
Let's solve this step by step:

1. The first row must be in ascending order, so the missing numbers are 6 and 7.
2. The second row must be in descending order, so the missing numbers are 6 and 5.
3. The third row must be in ascending order, so the missing numbers are 8 and 9.
4. The fourth row must be in descending order, so the missing numbers are 7 and 5.

Now, let's fill in the missing numbers:

1. The first row: 6 7 5 9
2. The second row: 8 4 8 5
3. The third row: 5 9 10 8
4. The fourth row: 6 8 7 5

The sum of all the numbers in the board is 6 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 4 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 9 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 107

The answer is /boxed/107.
