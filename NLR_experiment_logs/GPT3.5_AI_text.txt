What is the difference between the length of the longest and shortest sides after these actions? Round the answer to 2 decimal points.', 'type': 'algorithmic_instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 0.11}
Let's calculate the length of each side of the square fabric after each action:

1. Stretch the top edge by 1%: Top edge = 5m + 5m * 0.01 = 5.05m
   Stretch the sides by 2%: Side edges = 5m + 5m * 0.02 = 5.10m
   Stretch the bottom edge by 3%: Bottom edge = 5m + 5m * 0.03 = 5.15m

2. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise: The sides are now the top and bottom edges, and the top and bottom edges are now the sides. So, the lengths are:
   Top edge = 5.10m
   Sides = 5.05m
   Bottom edge = 5.15m

3. Stretch the top edge by 1%: Top edge = 5.10m + 5.10m * 0.01 = 5.151m
   Stretch the sides by 2%: Sides = 5.05m + 5.05m * 0.02 = 5.151m
   Stretch the bottom edge by 3%: Bottom edge = 5.15m + 5.15m * 0.03 = 5.3045m

4. Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise: The sides are now the top and bottom edges, and the top and bottom edges are now the sides. So, the lengths are:
   Top edge = 5.151m
   Sides = 5.151m
   Bottom edge = 5.3045m

5. Stretch the top edge by 1%: Top edge = 5.151m + 5.151m * 0.01 = 5.20251m
   Stretch the sides by 2%: Sides = 5.151m + 5.151m * 0.02 = 5.25302m
   Stretch the bottom edge by 3%: Bottom edge = 5.3045m + 5.3045m * 0.03 = 5.463435m

6. Rotate 180 degrees: The sides are now the top and bottom edges, and the top and bottom edges are now the sides. So, the lengths are:
   Top edge = 5.25302m
   Sides = 5.20251m
   Bottom edge = 5.463435m

7. Stretch the top edge by 1%: Top edge = 5.25302m + 5.25302m * 0.01 = 5.3055502m
   Stretch the sides by 2%: Sides = 5.20251m + 5.20251m * 0.02 = 5.30655102m
   Stretch the bottom edge by 3%: Bottom edge = 5.463435m + 5.463435m * 0.03 = 5.61814005m

The difference between the longest and shortest sides after these actions is:
Longest side = 5.61814005m
Shortest side = 5.20251m

Difference = 5.61814005m - 5.20251m = 0.41563m

Therefore, the difference between the length of the longest and shortest sides after these actions is /boxed/0.42.

{'statement': 'Alex is playing Hexascratch, a game with a hexagon that has two black sides and four gray sides. The hexagon is initially oriented so the top side is the black, and the 5th side (counting clockwise) is black. Alex can do three actions: Action-right rotates the hexagon clockwise by 120 degrees (2 sides) and scratches the top side after the rotation; Action-left turns hexagon by 60 degrees counterclockwise and then scratches the bottom side; Action-180 which rotates the hexagon by 180 degrees (3 sides) and scratches the sides on the top and bottom. Alex performs the following actions: Action-right, Action-left, Action-right, Action-180. What is the number of scratches on the black sides minus the number on the gray sides?', 'type': 'algorithmic_instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': -1}
Let's break down the actions taken by Alex:

1. Action-right: The hexagon is rotated clockwise by 120 degrees, so the 5th side (black) becomes the top side and gets scratched.

2. Action-left: The hexagon is rotated counterclockwise by 60 degrees, so the top side (previously the 5th side) becomes the bottom side and gets scratched.

3. Action-right: The hexagon is rotated clockwise by 120 degrees, so the bottom side (previously the top side) becomes the black side and gets scratched.

4. Action-180: The hexagon is rotated by 180 degrees, so the black side that was previously the bottom side gets scratched, and the black side that was previously the top side also gets scratched.

After these actions, the hexagon is back to its original orientation with the top side being black and the 5th side being black.

The number of scratches on the black sides is 2 (top and bottom) and the number of scratches on the gray sides is 4.

Therefore, the number of scratches on the black sides minus the number on the gray sides is 2 - 4 = -2.

The answer is /boxed/-2.

In each round, we roll a 3-sided dice (with numbers 1 to 3) to determine the number of “moves” per round. After each round, a 1 kg weight is added to the lighter rod. The weight of the rods is recalculated after each move in a round. Initially, the first rod holds 1, 5, 3 kg, top to bottom, and the second holds 4, 2 kg. If the dice rolls are 2, 1, 3, 1 in the first four rounds, what is the sum of the weights on the heavier rod after the fourth round?", 'type': 'algorithmic_instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 10}
Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: The dice rolls a 2, so there are 2 moves.
- Move 1: Transfer the 5 kg weight from the first rod to the second rod. Rods: 1, 3 kg and 4, 2, 5 kg.
- Move 2: Transfer the 4 kg weight from the second rod to the first rod. Rods: 1, 3, 4 kg and 2, 5 kg.

Round 2: The dice rolls a 1, so there is 1 move.
- Move 1: Transfer the 5 kg weight from the first rod to the second rod. Rods: 1, 3, 4, 5 kg and 2 kg.

Round 3: The dice rolls a 3, so there are 3 moves.
- Move 1: Transfer the 5 kg weight from the first rod to the second rod. Rods: 1, 3, 4, 5 kg and 2, 2 kg.
- Move 2: Transfer the 4 kg weight from the first rod to the second rod. Rods: 1, 3, 5 kg and 2, 2, 4 kg.
- Move 3: Transfer the 5 kg weight from the first rod to the second rod. Rods: 1, 3 kg and 2, 2, 4, 5 kg.

Round 4: The dice rolls a 1, so there is 1 move.
- Move 1: Transfer the 5 kg weight from the first rod to the second rod. Rods: 1, 3, 5 kg and 2, 2, 4, 5 kg.

After the fourth round, the sum of the weights on the heavier rod is 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 kg.

2. After flipping the plate around the top left bottom right diagonal and adding five designs to the top right subsquare:

{'statement': "In 'flip it' a player interacts with a 4x4 grid of discs with a black and a white side. Initially, all discs display their white side. In each round, the player chooses a specific coordinate on the grid and rolls an 8-sided dice to determine the number of adjacent discs to flip. The first disc to be flipped is the one directly above the selected grid, the flipping of the rest of the adjacent disks proceeds clockwise. If the selected grid is on the corner or edge of the grid with less than 8 neighbors, and the dice roll exceeds the number of neighboring discs, all neighboring discs are flipped. Determine how many discs will be showing their black side after four rounds, choosing to flip discs along the diagonal of the grid, starting from the top left disc (1, 1) and moving to the bottom right disc (4, 4) with dice rolls of 4, 7, 4, 3.", 'type': 'algorithmic_instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 8}
Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: Starting from disc (1, 1), we flip 4 adjacent discs. Since there are only 3 discs adjacent to (1, 1), all of them will be flipped. So, after round 1, there are 4 black discs.

Round 2: Moving to disc (2, 2), we flip 7 adjacent discs. There are 5 discs adjacent to (2, 2), so all of them will be flipped. So, after round 2, there are 9 black discs.

Round 3: Moving to disc (3, 3), we flip 4 adjacent discs. There are 5 discs adjacent to (3, 3), so all of them will be flipped. So, after round 3, there are 13 black discs.

Round 4: Moving to disc (4, 4), we flip 3 adjacent discs. There are 3 discs adjacent to (4, 4), so all of them will be flipped. So, after round 4, there are 16 black discs.

Therefore, after four rounds, there are 16 discs showing their black side.

The answer is /boxed/16.
