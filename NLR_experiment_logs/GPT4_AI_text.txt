What is the difference between the length of the longest and shortest sides after these actions? Round the answer to 2 decimal points.', 'type': 'Algorithmic Instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 0.11}
Let's solve this step by step:

1. The scientist starts with a square fabric with a side length of 5m. 

2. He stretches the top edge by 1%, the sides by 2%, and the bottom edge by 3%. The fabric is now a quadrilateral with sides of lengths 5.03m (bottom), 5.02m (sides), and 5.01m (top).

3. He rotates the fabric 90 degrees clockwise. The sides are now 5.03m (left), 5.02m (top and bottom), and 5.01m (right).

4. He stretches the fabric again. The sides are now 5.04m (left), 5.04m (top and bottom), and 5.03m (right).

5. He rotates the fabric 90 degrees counterclockwise. The sides are now 5.04m (top), 5.04m (right and left), and 5.03m (bottom).

6. He stretches the fabric again. The sides are now 5.07m (top), 5.06m (right and left), and 5.05m (bottom).

7. He rotates the fabric 180 degrees. The sides are now 5.07m (bottom), 5.06m (right and left), and 5.05m (top).

8. He stretches the fabric one last time. The sides are now 5.10m (bottom), 5.08m (right and left), and 5.06m (top).

The difference between the length of the longest and shortest sides after these actions is 5.10m - 5.06m = 0.04m.

The answer is /boxed/0.04.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Action-right: The hexagon rotates clockwise by 120 degrees (2 sides). The top side (which was originally the 3rd side) is scratched. This side is gray.

2. Action-left: The hexagon rotates counterclockwise by 60 degrees (1 side). The bottom side (which was originally the 2nd side) is scratched. This side is gray.

3. Action-right: The hexagon rotates clockwise by 120 degrees (2 sides). The top side (which was originally the 5th side) is scratched. This side is black.

4. Action-180: The hexagon rotates by 180 degrees (3 sides). The top and bottom sides (which were originally the 2nd and 5th sides) are scratched. These sides are gray and black, respectively.

So, the number of scratches on the black sides is 2, and the number of scratches on the gray sides is 3. Therefore, the number of scratches on the black sides minus the number on the gray sides is 3 - 2 = 1.

The answer is /boxed/1.

Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: The dice roll is 2, so we make 2 moves. 

Move 1: We transfer the top weight from the first rod (1 kg) to the second rod. The first rod now holds 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 4, 2 kg.

Move 2: We transfer the top weight from the second rod (1 kg) back to the first rod. The first rod now holds 1, 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 4, 2 kg.

After the round, we add a 1 kg weight to the lighter rod (the second rod). The first rod now holds 1, 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 4, 2 kg.

Round 2: The dice roll is 1, so we make 1 move. 

Move 1: We transfer the top weight from the first rod (1 kg) to the second rod. The first rod now holds 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 1, 4, 2 kg.

After the round, we add a 1 kg weight to the lighter rod (the first rod). The first rod now holds 1, 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 1, 4, 2 kg.

Round 3: The dice roll is 3, so we make 3 moves. 

Move 1: We transfer the top weight from the second rod (1 kg) to the first rod. The first rod now holds 1, 1, 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 4, 2 kg.

Move 2: We transfer the top weight from the first rod (1 kg) back to the second rod. The first rod now holds 1, 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 1, 4, 2 kg.

Move 3: We transfer the top weight from the second rod (1 kg) to the first rod. The first rod now holds 1, 1, 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 4, 2 kg.

After the round, we add a 1 kg weight to the lighter rod (the second rod). The first rod now holds 1, 1, 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 1, 4, 2 kg.

Round 4: The dice roll is 1, so we make 1 move. 

Move 1: We transfer the top weight from the first rod (1 kg) to the second rod. The first rod now holds 1, 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 1, 1, 4, 2 kg.

After the round, we add a 1 kg weight to the lighter rod (the first rod). The first rod now holds 1, 1, 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 1, 1, 4, 2 kg.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Sarah starts with a chain of 5 magnetic beads, with the middle bead being the only one with a scratch. Let's represent the chain as follows: 1-2-S-4-5, where 'S' is the scratched bead.

2. In the first round, Sarah rolls a 4. She disconnects the beads before the 4th index, which results in two segments: 1-2-S-4 and 5. She adds a total of 4 beads to the two segments, resulting in: 1-2-S-4-B and B-5-B-B, where 'B' represents the added beads. She then reverses the order of the two segments and reconnects them into a single chain: B-5-B-B-1-2-S-4-B.

3. In the second round, Sarah rolls a 4 again. She disconnects the beads before the 4th index, which results in two segments: B-5-B-B and 1-2-S-4-B. She adds a total of 4 beads to the two segments, resulting in: B-5-B-B-B and B-1-2-S-4-B-B. She then reverses the order of the two segments and reconnects them into a single chain: B-1-2-S-4-B-B-B-5-B-B-B.

4. In the third round, Sarah rolls a 3. She disconnects the beads before the 3rd index, which results in two segments: B-1-2 and S-4-B-B-B-5-B-B-B. She adds a total of 4 beads to the two segments, resulting in: B-1-2-B and B-S-4-B-B-B-5-B-B-B-B. She then reverses the order of the two segments and reconnects them into a single chain: B-S-4-B-B-B-5-B-B-B-B-B-1-2-B.

5. In the fourth round, Sarah rolls a 2. She disconnects the beads before the 2nd index, which results in two segments: B-S and 4-B-B-B-5-B-B-B-B-B-1-2-B. She adds a total of 4 beads to the two segments, resulting in: B-S-B and B-4-B-B-B-5-B-B-B-B-B-1-2-B-B. She then reverses the order of the two segments and reconnects them into a single chain: B-4-B-B-B-5-B-B-B-B-B-1-2-B-B-B-S-B.

So, the position of the scratched bead counting from 0 from left to right is 16.

What's the sum of the numbers in the 10 squares after the waitlist is empty?", 'type': 'Algorithmic Instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 5}
Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: The target square is the first 0, which is the 4th square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 3 + 4 = 7, which equals the first waitlist number. So, the numbers in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th squares become zero. The squares now contain 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0.

Round 3: The target square is now the 2nd square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 1 + 0 = 1, which does not equal the third waitlist number. So, the number in the 2nd square becomes the third waitlist number, 6. The squares now contain 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0.

Round 4: The target square is now the 3rd square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 6 + 0 = 6, which does not equal the fourth waitlist number. So, the number in the 3rd square becomes the fourth waitlist number, 2. The squares now contain 1, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0.

Round 5: The target square is now the 4th square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 2 + 0 = 2, which equals the fifth waitlist number. So, the numbers in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th squares become zero. The squares now contain 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0.

After the waitlist is empty, the sum of the numbers in the 10 squares is 1 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 1 - 1 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Let's solve this step by step:

The initial list is: 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 8, 6, 3, 2.

We start by checking the first three numbers: 3, 5, 7. They are strictly increasing and the difference between the first and third number is 4, which is less than 5 and more than 3. So, this is a special 3. We add 1 to all the numbers that come after the third number in the line: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 9, 7, 4, 3. The count of special 3s is now 1.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 5, 7, 9. They are strictly increasing and the difference between the first and third number is 4, which is less than 5 and more than 3. So, this is a special 3. We add 1 to all the numbers that come after the third number in the line: 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 10, 8, 5, 4. The count of special 3s is now 2.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 7, 9, 12. They are strictly increasing but the difference between the first and third number is 5, which is not less than 5. So, this is not a special 3.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 9, 12, 14. They are strictly increasing but the difference between the first and third number is 5, which is not less than 5. So, this is not a special 3.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 12, 14, 10. They are not strictly increasing or decreasing. So, this is not a special 3.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 14, 10, 8. They are strictly decreasing and the difference between the first and third number is 6, which is not less than 5. So, this is not a special 3.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 10, 8, 5. They are strictly decreasing and the difference between the first and third number is 5, which is not less than 5. So, this is not a special 3.

Next, we check the last three numbers: 8, 5, 4. They are strictly decreasing and the difference between the first and third number is 4, which is less than 5 and more than 3. So, this is a special 3. However, there are no numbers after the third number in the line, so we don't add 1 to any numbers. The count of special 3s is now 3.

The final list is: 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 10, 8, 5, 4. The sum of all the numbers in the final list is 77.

The sum of the count of special 3s and all of the numbers in the final list is 3 + 77 = 80.

Each quarter holds $100. The game starts with A, followed by B, C, and D.  If in rounds 1 to 4, A draws “Take 20% of your quarter's money, spin the board 90 degrees”, B draws “spin the board by 180 degrees, give 50% of your money to the quarter in front of you”, C draws “take 10% of your quarter’s money, spin the board by 90 degrees”, and D draws “Take 30% of your quarter’s money, do not spin the board”, then what's the difference between the total players' money and the total quarters' money after 4 rounds?", 'type': 'Algorithmic Instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': -28}
Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: Player A draws "Take 20% of your quarter's money, spin the board 90 degrees". Player A takes $20 from quarter 1 (20% of $100) and spins the board 90 degrees clockwise. Now, player A has $40 and is sitting in front of quarter 4, B is in front of quarter 1, C is in front of quarter 2, and D is in front of quarter 3. The money in the quarters is $80 in quarter 1, and $100 in quarters 2, 3, and 4.

Round 2: Player B draws "spin the board by 180 degrees, give 50% of your money to the quarter in front of you". Player B spins the board 180 degrees and gives $35 to quarter 3 (50% of $70). Now, player A is sitting in front of quarter 2, B is in front of quarter 3, C is in front of quarter 4, and D is in front of quarter 1. Player B now has $35. The money in the quarters is $80 in quarter 1, $100 in quarter 2, $135 in quarter 3, and $100 in quarter 4.

Round 3: Player C draws "take 10% of your quarter’s money, spin the board by 90 degrees". Player C takes $10 from quarter 4 (10% of $100) and spins the board 90 degrees clockwise. Now, player A is sitting in front of quarter 1, B is in front of quarter 2, C is in front of quarter 3, and D is in front of quarter 4. Player C now has $50. The money in the quarters is $80 in quarter 1, $100 in quarter 2, $125 in quarter 3, and $90 in quarter 4.

Round 4: Player D draws "Take 30% of your quarter’s money, do not spin the board". Player D takes $27 from quarter 4 (30% of $90). The board does not spin. Player D now has $52. The money in the quarters is $80 in quarter 1, $100 in quarter 2, $125 in quarter 3, and $63 in quarter 4.

After 4 rounds, the total players' money is $40 (A) + $35 (B) + $50 (C) + $52 (D) = $177. The total quarters' money is $80 (quarter 1) + $100 (quarter 2) + $125 (quarter 3) + $63 (quarter 4) = $368.

The difference between the total players' money and the total quarters' money after 4 rounds is $368 - $177 = $191.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. The artist begins by rotating the plate 180 degrees clockwise. The red subsquare is now at the bottom right, and moving clockwise, the subsquares are purple, red, blue, and orange.

2. He adds three designs to the top right subsquare (purple) and two to the bottom left subsquare (blue).

3. He flips the plate around the top left bottom right diagonal of the square. The red subsquare is now at the top left, and moving clockwise, the subsquares are red, orange, purple, and blue.

We add 1 to the start of the smaller sum sublist and -1 to the start of the larger one, resulting in [4, 6, 6, 9], [1, 2, 1, 4], [6, 5, 8, 3].

Round 2: The random numbers are (7, 11). This splits the list into three sublists: [4, 6, 6, 9, 1, 2, 1], [4], [6, 5, 8, 3]. The sums of the outer sublists are 34 and 22. We add 1 to the start of the smaller sum sublist and -1 to the start of the larger one, resulting in [3, 4, 6, 6, 9, 1, 2, 1], [4], [7, 6, 5, 8, 3].

Round 3: The random numbers are (4, 11). This splits the list into three sublists: [3, 4, 6, 6], [9, 1, 2, 1, 4], [7, 6, 5, 8, 3]. The sums of the outer sublists are 19 and 29. We add 1 to the start of the smaller sum sublist and -1 to the start of the larger one, resulting in [6, 3, 4, 6, 6], [9, 1, 2, 1, 4], [8, 7, 6, 5, 8, 3].

Round 4: The random numbers are (4, 9). This splits the list into three sublists: [6, 3, 4, 6], [6, 9, 1, 2, 1], [4, 8, 7, 6, 5, 8, 3]. The sums of the outer sublists are 19 and 37. We add 1 to the start of the smaller sum sublist and -1 to the start of the larger one, resulting in [3, 6, 3, 4, 6], [6, 9, 1, 2, 1], [9, 4, 8, 7, 6, 5, 8, 3].

The final list is [3, 6, 3, 4, 6, 6, 9, 1, 2, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 6, 5, 8, 3]. The sum of the first 12 numbers is 3 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 9 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 9 + 4 = 54.

The answer is /boxed/54.

{'statement': "In 'flip it' a player interacts with a 4x4 grid of discs with a black and a white side. Initially, all discs display their white side. In each round, the player chooses a specific coordinate on the grid and rolls an 8-sided dice to determine the number of adjacent discs to flip. The first disc to be flipped is the one directly above the selected grid, the flipping of the rest of the adjacent disks proceeds clockwise. If the selected grid is on the corner or edge of the grid with less than 8 neighbors, and the dice roll exceeds the number of neighboring discs, all neighboring discs are flipped. Determine how many discs will be showing their black side after four rounds, choosing to flip discs along the diagonal of the grid, starting from the top left disc (1, 1) and moving to the bottom right disc (4, 4) with dice rolls of 4, 7, 4, 3.", 'type': 'Algorithmic Instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 8}
Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: The player chooses the top left disc (1, 1) and rolls a 4. Since this disc is in the corner and only has 3 neighbors, all 3 neighboring discs are flipped. So, there are 4 discs showing their black side.

Round 2: The player moves along the diagonal to disc (2, 2) and rolls a 7. This disc has 8 neighbors, so 7 of them are flipped. However, 3 of these were already showing their black side from the previous round, so only 4 new discs are flipped. So, there are 4 (from round 1) + 4 (from round 2) = 8 discs showing their black side.

Round 3: The player moves along the diagonal to disc (3, 3) and rolls a 4. This disc has 8 neighbors, so 4 of them are flipped. However, 2 of these were already showing their black side from the previous rounds, so only 2 new discs are flipped. So, there are 8 (from rounds 1 and 2) + 2 (from round 3) = 10 discs showing their black side.

Round 4: The player moves along the diagonal to disc (4, 4) and rolls a 3. Since this disc is in the corner and only has 3 neighbors, all 3 neighboring discs are flipped. However, 1 of these was already showing its black side from the previous rounds, so only 2 new discs are flipped. So, there are 10 (from rounds 1, 2, and 3) + 2 (from round 4) = 12 discs showing their black side.

So, after four rounds, there are 12 discs showing their black side.

The answer is /boxed/12.
