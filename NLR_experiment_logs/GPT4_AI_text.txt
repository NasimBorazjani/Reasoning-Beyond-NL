Let's solve this step by step:

1. The scientist starts with a square fabric with a side length of 5m. 

2. He stretches the top edge by 1%, the sides by 2%, and the bottom edge by 3%. The fabric is now a quadrilateral with sides of lengths 5.03m (bottom), 5.02m (sides), and 5.01m (top).

3. He rotates the fabric 90 degrees clockwise. The sides are now 5.03m (left), 5.02m (top and bottom), and 5.01m (right).

4. He stretches the fabric again. The sides are now 5.04m (left), 5.04m (top and bottom), and 5.02m (right).

5. He rotates the fabric 90 degrees counterclockwise. The sides are now 5.04m (top), 5.04m (right and left), and 5.02m (bottom).

6. He stretches the fabric again. The sides are now 5.07m (top), 5.06m (right and left), and 5.05m (bottom).

7. He rotates the fabric 180 degrees. The sides are now 5.07m (bottom), 5.06m (right and left), and 5.05m (top).

8. He stretches the fabric one last time. The sides are now 5.10m (bottom), 5.08m (right and left), and 5.06m (top).

The difference between the length of the longest and shortest sides after these actions is 5.10m - 5.06m = 0.04m.

The answer is /boxed/0.04.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Action-right: The hexagon rotates clockwise by 120 degrees (2 sides). The top side after the rotation is gray and gets scratched. So, we have 0 scratches on black sides and 1 scratch on gray sides.

2. Action-left: The hexagon rotates 60 degrees counterclockwise. The bottom side after the rotation is black and gets scratched. So, we have 1 scratch on black sides and 1 scratch on gray sides.

3. Action-right: The hexagon rotates clockwise by 120 degrees (2 sides). The top side after the rotation is black and gets scratched. So, we have 2 scratches on black sides and 1 scratch on gray sides.

4. Action-180: The hexagon rotates by 180 degrees (3 sides). The sides on the top and bottom are both gray and get scratched. So, we have 2 scratches on black sides and 3 scratches on gray sides.

The number of scratches on the black sides minus the number on the gray sides is 2 - 3 = -1.

The answer is /boxed/-1.

Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: The dice roll is 2, so we make 2 moves. 

Move 1: We transfer the top weight from the first rod (1 kg) to the second rod. The first rod now holds 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 1, 4, 2 kg.

Move 2: We transfer the top weight from the second rod (1 kg) back to the first rod. The first rod now holds 1, 5, 3 kg and the second rod holds 4, 2 kg.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Sarah starts with a chain of 5 magnetic beads, with the middle bead being the only one with a scratch. The chain looks like this: 1-2-S-4-5.

2. In the first round, Sarah rolls a 4. She disconnects the chain at the 4th index, which results in two segments: 1-2-S-4 and 5. She adds a total of 4 beads to the two segments, one bead to the front and back of each of the two resulting segments. The two segments now look like this: B-1-2-S-4-B and B-5-B.

Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: The target square is the first 0, which is the 4th square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 3 + 4 = 7, which matches the first waitlist number. So, the numbers in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th squares become zero. The squares now contain: 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0.

Round 4: The target square is now the 3rd square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 6 + 0 = 6, which does not match the fourth waitlist number. So, the round ends with the waitlist number replacing the 0 in the target square. The squares now contain: 1, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0.

Round 5: The target square is now the 4th square. The sum of the numbers before and after the target square is 2 + 0 = 2, which matches the fifth waitlist number. So, the numbers in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th squares become zero. The squares now contain: 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0.

After the waitlist is empty, the sum of the numbers in the 10 squares is 1 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 1 - 1 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Let's solve this step by step:

The initial list is: 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 8, 6, 3, 2.

We start by checking the first three numbers: 3, 5, 7. They are strictly increasing and the difference between the first and third number is 4, which is less than 5 and more than 3. So, this is a special 3. We add 1 to all the numbers that come after the third number in the line: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 9, 7, 4, 3.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 5, 7, 9. They are strictly increasing and the difference between the first and third number is 4, which is less than 5 and more than 3. So, this is another special 3. We add 1 to all the numbers that come after the third number in the line: 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 10, 8, 5, 4.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 7, 9, 12. They are strictly increasing, but the difference between the first and third number is 5, which is not less than 5. So, this is not a special 3.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 9, 12, 14. They are strictly increasing, but the difference between the first and third number is 5, which is not less than 5. So, this is not a special 3.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 12, 14, 10. They are not strictly increasing or decreasing. So, this is not a special 3.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 14, 10, 8. They are strictly decreasing and the middle number is divisible by 3. So, this is another special 3. We add 1 to all the numbers that come after the third number in the line: 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 10, 9, 6, 5.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 10, 9, 6. They are strictly decreasing and the difference between the first and third number is 4, which is less than 5 and more than 3. So, this is another special 3. We add 1 to all the numbers that come after the third number in the line: 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 10, 9, 7, 6.

Next, we check the next three numbers: 9, 7, 6. They are strictly decreasing, but the difference between the first and third number is 3, which is not more than 3. So, this is not a special 3.

Finally, we check the last three numbers: 7, 6, 5. They are strictly decreasing, but the difference between the first and third number is 2, which is not more than 3. So, this is not a special 3.

So, the final list is: 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 10, 9, 7, 6. The sum of all the numbers in the final list is 82.

The count of special 3s is 4.

Therefore, the sum of the count of special 3s and all of the numbers in the final list is 82 + 4 = 86.

Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: Player A draws "Take 20% of your quarter's money, spin the board 90 degrees". Player A takes $20 from quarter 1 and the board spins 90 degrees. Player A now has $40 and quarter 1 has $80.

Round 2: Player B is now in front of quarter 1. He draws "spin the board by 180 degrees, give 50% of your money to the quarter in front of you". The board spins 180 degrees and Player B gives $35 to quarter 3. Player B now has $35 and quarter 3 has $135.

Round 3: Player C is now in front of quarter 1. He draws "take 10% of your quarter’s money, spin the board by 90 degrees". Player C takes $8 from quarter 1 and the board spins 90 degrees. Player C now has $48 and quarter 1 has $72.

Round 4: Player D is now in front of quarter 2. He draws "Take 30% of your quarter’s money, do not spin the board". Player D takes $30 from quarter 2. Player D now has $55 and quarter 2 has $70.

After 4 rounds, the total players' money is $40 (Player A) + $35 (Player B) + $48 (Player C) + $55 (Player D) = $178.

The total quarters' money is $72 (quarter 1) + $70 (quarter 2) + $135 (quarter 3) + $100 (quarter 4) = $377.

The difference between the total players' money and the total quarters' money after 4 rounds is $377 - $178 = $199.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. The artist begins by rotating the plate 180 degrees clockwise. The top left subsquare is now orange, and moving clockwise, the subsquares are purple, red, and blue.

2. He adds three designs to the top right subsquare (purple) and two to the bottom left subsquare (red).

3. He flips the plate around the top left bottom right diagonal of the square. The top left subsquare is now red, and moving clockwise, the subsquares are blue, orange, and purple.

4. He adds five designs to the top right subsquare (blue).

Given the list is 5, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6, 6, 9 and the random numbers for four rounds of splits are (3, 7), (7, 11), (4, 11), (4, 9), what is the sum of the first 12 numbers in the final list?", 'type': 'algorithmic_instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 26}
Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: The random numbers are (3, 7). This splits the list into three sublists: [5, 8, 3], [1, 2, 1, 4], [6, 6, 9]. The sums of the outer sublists are 16 and 21. We add 1 to the start of the smaller sum sublist and -1 to the start of the larger one, resulting in [5, 8, 3], [2, 2, 1, 4], [5, 6, 9]. We then merge the sublists in the order: Outer sublist with larger sum, middle sublist, outer sublist with smaller sum. The list after the first round is [5, 6, 9, 2, 2, 1, 4, 5, 8, 3].

Round 2: The random numbers are (7, 11). This splits the list into three sublists: [5, 6, 9, 2, 2, 1, 4], [], [5, 8, 3]. The sums of the outer sublists are 29 and 16. We add 1 to the start of the smaller sum sublist and -1 to the start of the larger one, resulting in [4, 6, 9, 2, 2, 1, 4], [], [6, 8, 3]. We then merge the sublists in the order: Outer sublist with larger sum, middle sublist, outer sublist with smaller sum. The list after the second round is [4, 6, 9, 2, 2, 1, 4, 6, 8, 3].

Round 3: The random numbers are (4, 11). This splits the list into three sublists: [4, 6, 9, 2], [2, 1, 4, 6, 8, 3], []. The sums of the outer sublists are 21 and 0. We add 1 to the start of the smaller sum sublist and -1 to the start of the larger one, resulting in [3, 6, 9, 2], [3, 1, 4, 6, 8, 3], []. We then merge the sublists in the order: Outer sublist with larger sum, middle sublist, outer sublist with smaller sum. The list after the third round is [3, 6, 9, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 8, 3].

Round 4: The random numbers are (4, 9). This splits the list into three sublists: [3, 6, 9, 2], [3, 1, 4], [6, 8, 3]. The sums of the outer sublists are 20 and 17. We add 1 to the start of the smaller sum sublist and -1 to the start of the larger one, resulting in [2, 6, 9, 2], [4, 1, 4], [7, 8, 3]. We then merge the sublists in the order: Outer sublist with larger sum, middle sublist, outer sublist with smaller sum. The list after the fourth round is [2, 6, 9, 2, 4, 1, 4, 7, 8, 3].

The sum of the first 12 numbers in the final list is the sum of all numbers in the list, which is 46.

The answer is /boxed/46.

{'statement': "In 'flip it' a player interacts with a 4x4 grid of discs with a black and a white side. Initially, all discs display their white side. In each round, the player chooses a specific coordinate on the grid and rolls an 8-sided dice to determine the number of adjacent discs to flip. The first disc to be flipped is the one directly above the selected grid, the flipping of the rest of the adjacent disks proceeds clockwise. If the selected grid is on the corner or edge of the grid with less than 8 neighbors, and the dice roll exceeds the number of neighboring discs, all neighboring discs are flipped. Determine how many discs will be showing their black side after four rounds, choosing to flip discs along the diagonal of the grid, starting from the top left disc (1, 1) and moving to the bottom right disc (4, 4) with dice rolls of 4, 7, 4, 3.", 'type': 'algorithmic_instructions', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 8}
Let's solve this step by step:

Round 1: The player chooses the top left disc (1, 1) and rolls a 4. Since this disc is in the corner and only has 3 neighboring discs, all 3 neighboring discs are flipped to their black side. The grid now looks like this:

W B B W
B W W W
B W W W
W W W W

Round 2: The player chooses the disc at (2, 2) and rolls a 7. This disc has 8 neighboring discs, so 7 of them are flipped to their black side. The grid now looks like this:

B B B W
B B B B
B B W W
W W W W

Round 3: The player chooses the disc at (3, 3) and rolls a 4. This disc has 8 neighboring discs, so 4 of them are flipped to their black side. The grid now looks like this:

B B B W
B B B B
B B B B
W B W W

Round 4: The player chooses the bottom right disc (4, 4) and rolls a 3. Since this disc is in the corner and only has 3 neighboring discs, all 3 neighboring discs are flipped to their black side. The grid now looks like this:

B B B W
B B B B
B B B B
W B B B

So, after four rounds, there are 15 discs showing their black side.

The answer is /boxed/15.
