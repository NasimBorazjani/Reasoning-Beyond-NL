{'statement': 'Sarah has some red cubes, red spheres, blue cubes, and blue spheres in her bag. We know the total number of blue objects is 1 and half times the number of red objects. The number of blue spheres is 4 less than half the total number of red objects, and the number of red spheres is 6 less than half the total number of blue objects. And the number of blue cubes is 2 less than 3 times the number of red cubes. What’s the total number of objects in Sarah’s bag?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 120}
Let's denote the number of red cubes, red spheres, blue cubes, and blue spheres as follows:

- Red cubes: R_c
- Red spheres: R_s
- Blue cubes: B_c
- Blue spheres: B_s

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1) B_c + B_s = 1.5(R_c + R_s) (The total number of blue objects is 1.5 times the number of red objects)
2) B_s = 0.5(R_c + R_s) - 4 (The number of blue spheres is 4 less than half the total number of red objects)
3) R_s = 0.5(B_c + B_s) - 6 (The number of red spheres is 6 less than half the total number of blue objects)
4) B_c = 3R_c - 2 (The number of blue cubes is 2 less than 3 times the number of red cubes)

We need to find the total number of objects in Sarah's bag, which is R_c + R_s + B_c + B_s.

Substitute equations 2, 3, and 4 into equation 1:

B_c + 0.5(R_c + R_s) - 4 + 0.5(B_c + B_s) - 6 = 1.5(R_c + R_s)

Simplify the equation:

B_c + 0.5R_c + 0.5R_s - 4 + 0.5B_c + 0.5B_s - 6 = 1.5R_c + 1.5R_s
1.5R_c - B_c + 0.5R_s + 0.5B_s = 10

Substitute equation 4 into the simplified equation:

1.5R_c - (3R_c - 2) + 0.5R_s + 0.5B_s = 10
-1.5R_c + 0.5R_s + 0.5B_s = 12

Now, we can substitute equation 3 into the above equation:

-1.5R_c + 0.5(0.5(B_c + B_s) - 6) + 0.5B_s = 12
-1.5R_c + 0.25B_c + 0.25B_s - 3 + 0.5B_s = 12
-1.5R_c + 0.25(3R_c - 2) + 0.25B_s - 3 + 0.5B_s = 12
-1.5R_c + 0.75R_c - 0.5 + 0.25B_s - 3 + 0.5B_s = 12
0.25R_c + 0.75B_s = 15

Now, we have two equations:

1) 0.25R_c + 0.75B_s = 15
2) B_c = 3R_c - 2

Solving these equations, we get R_c = 8, B_s = 20, B_c = 22, R_s = 7.

Therefore, the total number of objects in Sarah's bag is:

8 (red cubes) + 7 (red spheres) + 22 (blue cubes) + 20 (blue spheres) = 57

The answer is /boxed/57.

Let the radii of the rings be denoted as r1, r2, and r3.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1) 2 * pi * r1 + 2 * pi * r3 = 2 * (2 * pi * r2) - 2 * pi
2) 2 * pi * r1 + 2 * pi * r2 = 2 * pi * r3 + 9
3) 2 * pi * r3 = 2 * (2 * pi * r1 + 3 * pi) + 2 * pi * r2

From equation 1, we get:
2 * pi * (r1 + r3) = 4 * pi * r2 - 2 * pi
r1 + r3 = 2 * r2 - 1

From equation 2, we get:
2 * pi * (r1 + r2) = 2 * pi * r3 + 9
r1 + r2 = r3 + 4.5

Substitute r1 + r3 = 2 * r2 - 1 into r1 + r2 = r3 + 4.5:
2 * r2 - 1 + r2 = r3 + 4.5
3 * r2 - 1 = r3 + 4.5
r3 = 3 * r2 - 5.5

Substitute r3 = 3 * r2 - 5.5 into equation 1:
2 * pi * r1 + 2 * pi * (3 * r2 - 5.5) = 2 * (2 * pi * r2) - 2 * pi
2 * pi * r1 + 6 * pi * r2 - 11 pi = 4 * pi * r2 - 2 * pi
2 * pi * r1 = -2 * pi + 5 * pi
2 * pi * r1 = 3 * pi
r1 = 1.5

Substitute r1 = 1.5 into r1 + r2 = r3 + 4.5:
1.5 + r2 = 3 * r2 - 5.5 + 4.5
r2 = 2

Substitute r2 = 2 into r1 + r2 = r3 + 4.5:
1.5 + 2 = r3 + 4.5
r3 = -0.5

The sum of the radii of the 3 rings before adding the band is:
1.5 + 2 + (-0.5) = 3

Therefore, the sum of the radius of the 3 rings before adding the band is /boxed/3.

How much is X?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 10}
Let's denote the original amount each of the 12 friends agreed to contribute as A.

From the problem, we know that:
1) 10 friends each have to pay X dollars more, so the total amount they pay is 10(A + X).
2) 9 friends each pay 2*X dollars more than the original amount, so the total amount they pay is 9(A + 2*X).
3) The total amount they pay in scenario 2 is $30 more than the price of the violin, so 9(A + 2*X) = Price of the violin + $30.

Now, we can set up the equations:

1) 10(A + X) = 12A
2) 9(A + 2*X) = Price of the violin + $30

Solving equation 1 for A, we get A = 10X.

Substitute A = 10X into equation 2, we get 9(10X + 2X) = Price of the violin + $30
Simplify the equation: 90X = Price of the violin + $30
Rearrange the equation: Price of the violin = 90X - $30

Substitute Price of the violin = 90X - $30 into equation 2, we get 9(10X + 2X) = 90X - $30 + $30
Simplify the equation: 90X = 90X
This equation is true for all values of X.

Therefore, X can be any real number.

What is the sum of the size of the first, third, and fifth grades?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 420}
Let's denote the number of students in each grade as follows:

1st grade: x
2nd grade: y
3rd grade: z
4th grade: w
5th grade: v

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1) v = y + w - z
2) y = 2x - w
3) z + 2x = y + 2w
4) 2z + 2w + y = v + 2x

We also know that the total number of students is 700:

x + y + z + w + v = 700

Substitute equations 1, 2, and 3 into equation 4:

2z + 2w + (2x - w) = (y + w - z) + 2x
2z + 2w + 2x - w = y + w - z + 2x
2z + 2w + 2x - w = 2x - w + w - z + 2x
2z + 2w + 2x - w = 4x - z

Now, substitute this back into the total number of students equation:

x + (2x - w) + z + w + (y + w - z) = 700
3x + 2w + y = 700

Substitute y = 2x - w into the equation above:

3x + 2w + 2x - w = 700
5x + w = 700

Now, we can solve for x and w:

5x + w = 700
w = 700 - 5x

Substitute w = 700 - 5x into equation 2:

y = 2x - (700 - 5x)
y = 7x - 700

Substitute w = 700 - 5x into equation 1:

v = (7x - 700) + (700 - 5x) - z
v = 2x

Now, we can find z:

z + 2x = (7x - 700) + 2(700 - 5x)
z + 2x = 7x - 700 + 1400 - 10x
z + 2x = -3x + 700
z = -5x + 700

Now, we can find the sum of the size of the first, third, and fifth grades:

x + z + v = x + (-5x + 700) + 2x
x + z + v = -2x + 700

Substitute x = 700 - w into the equation above:

x + z + v = -2(700 - w) + 700
x + z + v = -1400 + 2w + 700
x + z + v = 2w - 700 + 700
x + z + v = 2w

Substitute w = 700 - 5x into the equation above:

x + z + v = 2(700 - 5x)
x + z + v = 1400 - 10x

Now, we can solve for x:

x + z + v = 1400 - 10x
11x = 1400
x = 127.27

Now, we can find z:

z = -5(127.27) + 700
z = -636.36 + 700
z = 63.64

Now, we can find v:

v = 2(127.27)
v = 254.54

Finally, we can find the sum of the size of the first, third, and fifth grades:

x + z + v = 127.27 + 63.64 + 254.54
x + z + v = 445.45

Therefore, the sum of the size of the first, third, and fifth grades is /boxed/445.45.

After another 5 years, the total population of the city increases by 40% from the newborns born in the past 5 years. Then a virus comes to the city and infects 30% of the adults, 20% of the young children (age 5 or above), and 60% of the newborns (age less than 5). 230 of the residents of this new city were not infected. What is the sum of the population of the children born in this city?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 250}
Let's denote the initial number of couples (adults) as A, the initial number of children as C, and the initial total population as P.

After 5 years, each couple has 3 kids, so the number of children after 5 years is 3A.

After another 5 years, the total population increases by 40% from the newborns born in the past 5 years, so the total population becomes 1.4 * (P + 3A).

The total population before the virus outbreak is P + 3A + 3C.

After the virus outbreak, 30% of the adults are infected, so 0.3A adults are infected. 20% of the young children are infected, so 0.2 * 3A = 0.6A young children are infected. 60% of the newborns are infected, so 0.6 * 3A = 1.8A newborns are infected. The total number of infected individuals is 0.3A + 0.6A + 1.8A = 2.7A.

230 residents were not infected, so the total population after the virus outbreak is P + 3A + 3C - 230.

Since the total population after the virus outbreak is the same as the number of infected individuals plus the number of residents not infected, we have:

P + 3A + 3C - 230 = 2.7A + 230

Substitute the values we know into the equation:

P + 3A + 3(3A) - 230 = 2.7A + 230
P + 3A + 9A - 230 = 2.7A + 230
P + 12A - 230 = 2.7A + 230
P - 230 = -9.3A + 230
P = -9.3A + 460

The sum of the population of the children born in this city is 3A + 3C = 3A + 3(3A) = 12A.

Substitute the value of P in terms of A into the sum of the children's population:

12A = 12(-9.3A + 460)
12A = -111.6A + 5520
123.6A = 5520
A = 5520 / 123.6
A ≈ 44.7154

Therefore, the sum of the population of the children born in this city is /boxed/44.7154.

By how many kilos are apples heavier than potatoes?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 24}
Let's denote the weights of potatoes, apples, and onions as P, A, and O respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1) P + A + O = 44 (total weight is 44 kg)
2) P + O = A - 20 (sum of potatoes and onions is 20 kg less than apples)
3) O = P / (1/16 * A) = 16P / A (onions are equal to the weight of potatoes divided by 1/16 of the weight of apples)

Substitute equation 3 into equation 2:

P + 16P / A = A - 20
17P = A^2 - 20A

We also know that the total weight is 44 kg:

P + A + 16P / A = 44
A^2 - 20A + 17P = 44

Now, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the weights of potatoes and apples.

By solving these equations, we find that P = 4 kg and A = 20 kg.

So, apples are heavier than potatoes by 20 - 4 = 16 kg.

Let's denote the current ages of the brothers as follows:

- John's age = J
- Blake's age = B
- Sam's age = S
- Frank's age = F

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1) S + 3 = 2(J + 3) (In three years, Sam will be twice as old as John)
2) B + 3 = S - F (Blake’s age will be equal to the age difference between Sam and Frank)
3) J + 8 = 2(B + 8) (In eight years, John's age would be twice Blake's age)
4) J + 8 = F - 2 (John would be 2 years younger than Frank’s current age)
5) S + B = J + F - 5 (The sum of Sam’s and Blake’s ages is 5 years less than the sum of John’s and Frank’s ages)

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously:

From equation 1:
S = 2J + 3

Substitute S = 2J + 3 into equation 2:
B + 3 = 2J + 3 - F
B = 2J - F

Substitute B = 2J - F into equation 3:
J + 8 = 2(2J - F + 8)
J + 8 = 4J - 2F + 16
3J + 2F = 8

Substitute S = 2J + 3 and B = 2J - F into equation 5:
2J + 3 + 2J - F = J + F - 5
4J - F = 6

Now, we have the system of equations:
3J + 2F = 8
4J - F = 6

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get J = 2, F = 2.5

Substitute J = 2 and F = 2.5 into equation 1:
S = 2(2) + 3
S = 7

Substitute J = 2 and F = 2.5 into equation 2:
B = 2(2) - 2.5
B = 1.5

The sum of the 4 brothers' ages right now is:
J + B + S + F = 2 + 1.5 + 7 + 2.5 = 13

Let's denote the number of candies in Brad's box as follows:

- Kit-Kats = K
- M&Ms = M
- Gummy Bears = G
- Lindt Chocolates = L

From the problem, we know the following:

1) K + M + G + L = Total number of candies
2) M + G + L = 43 (All but 43 candies are Kit-Kats)
3) K + G + L = 35 (All but 35 candies are Lindt Chocolates)
4) K + M + L = 39 (All but 39 candies are M&Ms)
5) K + M + G = 27 (All but 27 candies are Gummy Bears)

We are asked to find the sum of the number of Kit-Kats and Gummy Bears, which is K + G.

From equations 2, 3, 4, and 5, we can express K in terms of M, G, and L:

K = Total - (M + G + L)
K = Total - 43
K = Total - 35
K = Total - 39
K = Total - 27

Setting these equations equal to each other, we get:

Total - 43 = Total - 35 = Total - 39 = Total - 27

Solving this, we get Total = 43.

Substitute Total = 43 into equation 2, we get M + G + L = 43.

Substitute M + G + L = 43 into equation 5, we get K = 16.

What is the sum of the surface area of the two fields?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 88}
Let's denote the surface area of field 1 as A1, the surface area of field 2 as A2, the circumference of field 1 as C1, the circumference of field 2 as C2, the width of field 1 as W1, the width of field 2 as W2, the length of field 1 as L1, and the length of field 2 as L2.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1) A1 = 2A2 + 4
2) C1 = C2 + 10
3) W1 = W2 + 2
4) L1 = W2 + L2 - 1
5) W1 = L2 - 1

We need to find the sum of the surface area of the two fields, which is A1 + A2.

Substitute W1 = W2 + 2 into L1 = W2 + L2 - 1, we get L1 = W1 + L2 - 1.

Substitute W1 = L2 - 1 into W1 = L2 - 1, we get W1 = W1, which is always true.

Now, we can solve for the values of W1, W2, L1, and L2:

From equation (5), we have W1 = L2 - 1. Substitute this into equation (3), we get L2 - 1 = W2 + 2, which simplifies to L2 = W2 + 3.

Substitute L2 = W2 + 3 into equation (4), we get L1 = W2 + (W2 + 3) - 1, which simplifies to L1 = 2W2 + 2.

Substitute L1 = 2W2 + 2 into equation (1), we get A1 = 2A2 + 4 = 2(W2(W2 + 3)) + 4 = 2W2^2 + 6W2 + 4.

Now, we can find the sum of the surface area of the two fields:

A1 + A2 = 2W2^2 + 6W2 + 4 + W2(W2 + 3) = 3W2^2 + 9W2 + 4

To find the value of W2, we can solve the quadratic equation 3W2^2 + 9W2 + 4 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, we get W2 = (-9 ± sqrt(9^2 - 4*3*4)) / (2*3) = (-9 ± sqrt(81 - 48)) / 6 = (-9 ± sqrt(33)) / 6.

Since we are looking for a positive value for the width, we take W2 = (-9 + sqrt(33)) / 6.

Substitute W2 back into the equation for the sum of the surface area of the two fields:

A1 + A2 = 3(((-9 + sqrt(33)) / 6)^2) + 9((-9 + sqrt(33)) / 6) + 4

Calculating this expression gives the final answer.

a2 = 6
a8 = 0
a5 = 5

We can express all numbers in terms of a1:

a2 = a1 + a3 - a4
a3 = a2 + a4 - a5
a4 = a3 + a5 - a6
a5 = a4 + a6 - a7
a6 = a5 + a7 - a8
a7 = a6 + a8 - a9

Substitute the given values into the equations, we get:
a1 + 6 - a4 = a5
a6 + 0 - a9 = a7
a4 + 5 - a7 = a8

Substitute a5 = 5 into the first equation, we get:
a1 + 6 - a4 = 5
a1 + 6 - a4 = 5
a1 - a4 = -1

Substitute a7 = 0 into the second equation, we get:
a6 - a9 = 0
a6 = a9

Substitute a8 = 0 into the third equation, we get:
a4 + 5 - a7 = 0
a4 + 5 - 0 = 0
a4 = -5

Substitute a4 = -5 into the first equation, we get:
a1 - (-5) = -1
a1 + 5 = -1
a1 = -6

So, the numbers in the list are:
-6, 6, -5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0

The sum of all the numbers in the list is -6 + 6 - 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5.

The answer is /boxed/5.

The sum of the weight of the backpack and the book is equal to the weight of the lunch bag. He moves his sandwich which weighs 2 lbs from his lunch box to his container. Now the weight of the lunchbox is 4 times the weight of the container. Also, the lunch box is now 2 lb heavier than the sum of the weight of the backpack and the weight of the container. What is the sum of the weight of his backpack, container, lunch bag, and container?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 47}
Let's denote the weight of the container as c.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1) The weight of the book is 3 times the weight of the container: b = 3c
2) The sum of the weight of the backpack and the book is equal to the weight of the lunch bag: b + backpack = lunch bag
3) After moving the sandwich, the weight of the lunch box is 4 times the weight of the container: lunch box = 4c
4) The lunch box is now 2 lb heavier than the sum of the weight of the backpack and the weight of the container: lunch box = backpack + c + 2

Substitute b = 3c into equation 2), we get:
3c + backpack = lunch bag

Substitute lunch box = 4c into equation 4), we get:
4c = backpack + c + 2

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:
backpack = 2c - 2
lunch bag = 5c - 2

The sum of the weight of his backpack, container, lunch bag, and container is:
2c - 2 + c + 5c - 2 + c = 8c - 4

Therefore, the sum of the weight of his backpack, container, lunch bag, and container is /boxed/8.

{'statement': 'There are 3 trees (“X”, “Y”, “Z”) in a garden, and there are some birds in each tree. The birds in tree X tell the other birds in the garden that if 2 birds from Y and 1 bird from Z come to our tree, then our population would be double the population of birds in Y. Birds in Z think that after the move the population of X would be equal to their current population. Birds in Z propose another move, they tell other birds if 1 bird from X and 3 birds from Y come to our tree, then our population would be double the population of X. What’s the current number of all the birds in the garden?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 29}
Let's denote the current number of birds in trees X, Y, and Z as follows:

- Birds in tree X = x
- Birds in tree Y = y
- Birds in tree Z = z

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1) x = 2(y + 2)  (If 2 birds from Y and 1 bird from Z come to X)
2) z = x  (After the move proposed by birds in Z)
3) z = 2(x + 1)  (If 1 bird from X and 3 birds from Y come to Z)

Now, we can substitute equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

2(x + 1) = 2(y + 2)
2x + 2 = 2y + 4
2x = 2y + 2
x = y + 1

Substitute x = y + 1 into equation 1:

y + 1 = 2(y + 2)
y + 1 = 2y + 4
y = -3

Now we can find the number of birds in each tree:

x = y + 1 = -3 + 1 = -2
z = x = -2

So, the current number of birds in the garden is x + y + z = -2 + (-3) + (-2) = -7.

The answer is /boxed/-7.

{'statement': '4 friends (A, B, C, and D) go on a vacation for a day. They agree to each pay 10% of their income to cover the hotel rate for their stay. However, after checking in to the hotel, they were informed that they received a $20 discount on the rate; they decided to split this $20 equally between themselves. We know that C’s contribution before the discount was equal to the sum of A’s and B’s contributions before the discount. C’s contribution after the discount is equal to A’s and D’s contribution to the hotel price after the discount. The sum of A’s and D’s contributions before the discount is twice B’s contribution after the discount. The sum of B and D’s contributions before the discount is equal to the sum of A’s and C’s contributions after the discount. What is the sum of these 4 friend’s incomes?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 2000}
Let's denote the incomes of friends A, B, C, and D as follows:

Income of A = a
Income of B = b
Income of C = c
Income of D = d

From the problem, we know the following:

1) Each friend pays 10% of their income for the hotel rate, so after the $20 discount, they each pay 0.9 * 0.1 * income.
2) C's contribution before the discount is equal to the sum of A's and B's contributions before the discount: 0.9 * 0.1 * c = 0.9 * 0.1 * a + 0.9 * 0.1 * b
3) C's contribution after the discount is equal to A's and D's contribution after the discount: 0.9 * 0.1 * c - 20 = 0.9 * 0.1 * a + 0.9 * 0.1 * d
4) The sum of A's and D's contributions before the discount is twice B's contribution after the discount: 0.9 * 0.1 * a + 0.9 * 0.1 * d = 2 * (0.9 * 0.1 * b - 20)
5) The sum of B and D's contributions before the discount is equal to the sum of A's and C's contributions after the discount: 0.9 * 0.1 * b + 0.9 * 0.1 * d = 0.9 * 0.1 * a + 0.9 * 0.1 * c - 20

Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of a, b, c, and d.

After solving, we find that a = 400, b = 200, c = 600, d = 300.

The sum of these 4 friends' incomes is a + b + c + d = 400 + 200 + 600 + 300 = 1500.

Therefore, the sum of these 4 friends' incomes is /boxed/1500.

{'statement': 'We have 4 ropes, X, Y, Z, and T. We soaked the ropes in water, and the length of all ropes was reduced to ⅔ of their original length. The length of T before soaking is 1 meter shorter than the sum of the length of Y before soaking and X after soaking. Also, we realized if we add the length of Y after soaking to the length of T after soaking, we would get the original length of T. Similarly, to get the original length of Z, we can add the length of Z after soaking to the length of Y after soaking plus 1. Finally, we know the sum of lengths of X and Y before soaking is equal to the length of T before soaking plus the length of Y after soaking. What is the sum of the original lengths of the 4 ropes?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 63}
Let's denote the original lengths of the ropes as follows:

- Length of X before soaking = x
- Length of Y before soaking = y
- Length of Z before soaking = z
- Length of T before soaking = t

From the problem, we know that after soaking, the length of all ropes was reduced to ⅔ of their original length. So, the lengths after soaking are:

- Length of X after soaking = 2x/3
- Length of Y after soaking = 2y/3
- Length of Z after soaking = 2z/3
- Length of T after soaking = 2t/3

We are given the following relationships:

1) t = y + 2x/3 - 1
2) 2y/3 + 2t/3 = t
3) 2z/3 + 2y/3 + 1 = z
4) x + y = t + 2y/3

Now, let's solve these equations:

From equation 1:
t = y + 2x/3 - 1
=> 3t = 3y + 2x - 3

From equation 2:
2y/3 + 2t/3 = t
=> 2y + 2t = 3t
=> 2y + 2(2y + 2x/3 - 1)/3 = 3y + 2x - 3
=> 6y + 2(2y + 2x - 3)/3 = 9y + 6x - 9
=> 6y + 4y + 4x - 6 = 9y + 6x - 9
=> 4y + 4x = 3y + 6x - 3
=> x = y - 3

Substitute x = y - 3 into equation 4:
x + y = t + 2y/3
y - 3 + y = t + 2y/3
2y - 3 = t + 2y/3
6y - 9 = 3t + 2y
6y - 2y = 3t + 9
4y = 3t + 9
y = (3t + 9) / 4

Substitute y = (3t + 9) / 4 into equation 1:
t = (3t + 9) / 4 + 2(y - 3) / 3 - 1
4t = 3t + 9 + 8(y - 3) / 3 - 4
4t = 3t + 9 + 8(3t + 9) / 12 - 4
4t = 3t + 9 + 2t + 6 - 4
4t = 5t + 11
t = 11

Now, we can find the lengths of all ropes:

t = 11
y = (3(11) + 9) / 4 = 9
x = y - 3 = 6
z = 2y/3 + 1 = 7

The sum of the original lengths of the 4 ropes is:
x + y + z + t = 6 + 9 + 7 + 11 = 33

The answer is /boxed/33.

', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 11}
Let's denote the number of pens of each color as follows:

- Number of red pens = R
- Number of green pens = G
- Number of blue pens = B
- Number of yellow pens = Y

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1) All but 37 of the pens are blue: R + G + Y = B + 37
2) All but 32 of the pens are red: G + B + Y = R + 32
3) G = 3B - Y
4) R + B = G + Y - 3
5) 2R + Y = G + B

Now, we can substitute equations 3, 4, and 5 into equations 1 and 2:

1') R + G + Y = 4B + 37
2') G + B + Y = R + 32

Substitute G = 3B - Y into equation 1':

R + 3B - Y + Y = 4B + 37
R - B = 37

Substitute G = 3B - Y into equation 2':

3B - Y + B + Y = R + 32
4B = R + 32

Substitute R = 4B - 37 into the equation 5:

2(4B - 37) + Y = 3B + Y
8B - 74 + Y = 3B + Y
5B = 74
B = 14.8

Substitute B = 14.8 into R - B = 37:

R - 14.8 = 37
R = 51.8

Substitute B = 14.8 into 4B = R + 32:

4(14.8) = R + 32
59.2 = R + 32
R = 27.2

Substitute R = 27.2 into 2R + Y = G + B:

2(27.2) + Y = G + 14.8
54.4 + Y = G + 14.8
39.6 = G - Y

Therefore, the sum of the number of green and yellow pens minus the number of red ones is:

G + Y - R = 39.6

The answer is /boxed/39.6.

{'statement': 'Alex has 4 items in his bag, called A, B, C, and D. We know the total weight of his bag and the items is 12 kg. He can stack a lighter item on top of another item that’s 2 kg heavier. He stacks A on top of C and C on top of B. If his bag is one kg heavier than D, and A is 1 kg, how many kgs does his bag alone weigh?', 'type': 'mwp', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 2}
Let's denote the weights of items A, B, C, and D as a, b, c, and d respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1) a + b + c + d = 12 (total weight of the bag and items)
2) a = 1 (weight of item A)
3) a = c + 2 (A stacked on top of C)
4) c = b + 2 (C stacked on top of B)
5) d + 1 = 12 (bag is one kg heavier than D)

Substitute a = 1 into equations 3 and 4, we get:
1 = c + 2
1 = b + 4
c = -1
b = -3

Substitute c = -1 and b = -3 into equation 1, we get:
1 + (-3) + (-1) + d = 12
d = 15

So, the weights of items A, B, C, and D are 1, -3, -1, and 15 respectively.

The weight of the bag alone is d + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16 kg.

The answer is /boxed/16.
