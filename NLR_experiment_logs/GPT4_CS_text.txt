Let's denote the grid as follows:

6 2 a b
c d e 6
4 f g 2
h 6 2 i

From the problem, we know that:

1. The sum of each row and column equals 10. This means that a + b = 5, c + d + e = 4, f + g = 4, h + i = 2, 6 + c + 4 + h = 10, 2 + d + f + 6 = 10, a + e + g + 2 = 10, and b + 6 + 2 + i = 10.

2. The sum of the numbers in the top left 2x2 subgrid must be twice the number in grid(1, 1). This means that 6 + 2 + c + d = 2 * 6 = 12.

3. The sum of numbers in the bottom left 2x2 subgrid must be twice the number in grid(3, 1). This means that 4 + f + h + 6 = 2 * 4 = 8.

From these equations, we can solve for the unknowns:

From the first equation, we get a + b = 5. Since a and b are integers, the possible pairs are (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 1).

From the second equation, we get c + d + e = 4. Since c, d, and e are integers, the possible triples are (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1), (1, 3, 0), (3, 1, 0), (0, 1, 3), (0, 3, 1), (1, 0, 3), (3, 0, 1), (2, 2, 0), and (0, 2, 2).

From the third equation, we get f + g = 4. Since f and g are integers, the possible pairs are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1).

From the fourth equation, we get h + i = 2. Since h and i are integers, the possible pairs are (1, 1), (0, 2), (2, 0).

From the fifth equation, we get 6 + c + 4 + h = 10, which simplifies to c + h = 0. This means that c and h are both 0.

From the sixth equation, we get 2 + d + f + 6 = 10, which simplifies to d + f = 2. This means that d and f are either (1, 1), (0, 2), or (2, 0).

From the seventh equation, we get a + e + g + 2 = 10, which simplifies to a + e + g = 8. This means that a, e, and g are either (1, 1, 6), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 3), (1, 5, 2), (1, 6, 1), (2, 1, 5), (2, 2, 4), (2, 3, 3), (2, 4, 2), (2, 5, 1), (3, 1, 4), (3, 2, 3), (3, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (4, 1, 3), (4, 2, 2), (4, 3, 1), (5, 1, 2), (5, 2, 1), (6, 1, 1).

From the eighth equation, we get b + 6 + 2 + i = 10, which simplifies to b + i = 2. This means that b and i are either (1, 1), (0, 2), or (2, 0).

From the ninth equation, we get 6 + 2 + c + d = 12, which simplifies to c + d = 4. Since c = 0, this means that d = 4.

From the tenth equation, we get 4 + f + h + 6 = 8, which simplifies to f + h = -2. Since h = 0, this means that f = -2.

{'statement': 'Alex has invented a new type of resistors and is building a system using these resistors. The formula for total resistance when two resistors are connected in parallel is R_result = R1 + R2, and when they are connected in series, it is R_result = R1 - R2, where R1 is the first resistor from left to right. He has 4 resistors: R1, R2, R3, and R4. All resistors have a positive resistance measured in Ohms. The resistances of R1 and R2 are equal, the resistance of R4 is between 18 and 25 Ohms, and R3 has the highest resistance. Alex first connects R1 and R2 in parallel to create System 1. He then connects System 1 and R3 in parallel to form System 2.  He finally connects system 2 to the left of R4 in series to create system 3. The measured resistance of System 3 is 23 Ohms. Given that the resistance of R3 is 20 Ohms, what is the resistance of R1?', 'type': 'Constraint Satisfaction', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 11}
Let's denote the resistance of R1 as r1, the resistance of R2 as r2, the resistance of R3 as r3, and the resistance of R4 as r4.

From the problem, we know that:

1. r1 = r2 (the resistances of R1 and R2 are equal)
2. 18 < r4 < 25 (the resistance of R4 is between 18 and 25 Ohms)
3. r3 > r1, r3 > r2, r3 > r4 (R3 has the highest resistance)
4. r3 = 20 Ohms (the resistance of R3 is 20 Ohms)

Alex first connects R1 and R2 in parallel to create System 1. The resistance of System 1 (r_s1) is r_s1 = r1 + r2 = 2*r1 (since r1 = r2).

He then connects System 1 and R3 in parallel to form System 2. The resistance of System 2 (r_s2) is r_s2 = r_s1 + r3 = 2*r1 + 20.

He finally connects system 2 to the left of R4 in series to create system 3. The resistance of System 3 (r_s3) is r_s3 = r_s2 - r4.

The measured resistance of System 3 is 23 Ohms. So, we have the equation 23 = 2*r1 + 20 - r4.

We know that 18 < r4 < 25. Let's take the maximum possible value for r4, which is 25. Then, the equation becomes 23 = 2*r1 + 20 - 25, which simplifies to 2*r1 = 28. Solving for r1, we get r1 = 14 Ohms.

However, we know that r3 > r1, and r3 = 20 Ohms. So, r1 must be less than 20 Ohms. Therefore, r1 = 14 Ohms is not a valid solution.

Let's take the minimum possible value for r4, which is 18. Then, the equation becomes 23 = 2*r1 + 20 - 18, which simplifies to 2*r1 = 21. Solving for r1, we get r1 = 10.5 Ohms.

This value for r1 is less than r3, so it is a valid solution.

So, the resistance of R1 is 10.5 Ohms.

The answer is /boxed/10.5.

{'statement': 'We have a 5m x 5m grid with cubic blocks of 1m length placed on it. With some sensors around the grid we detected at least one block on grid (1, 1) (referring to the grid in the first row from left to right and first column from up down). The height of the stack of blocks on grid(1, 1) is less than 10m. This height is also twice the height of the stacks at positions (2, 1) and (2, 2). There is at least one block at position (3, 3), and the height of the stack at position (4, 4) is twice the height of the stack at (3, 3). The combined height of the stacks at positions (3, 3) and (4, 4) is less than the height at position (1, 1). A robot is placed at position (5, 5), where there are no blocks. The robot moves diagonally from its position, stopping at (1, 1), moving all blocks in its path. If the robot moves a total of 18 blocks, how many blocks were initially at position (4, 4)?', 'type': 'Constraint Satisfaction', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 4}
Let's denote the number of blocks at each position as follows:

- B(1, 1) = number of blocks at position (1, 1)
- B(2, 1) = number of blocks at position (2, 1)
- B(2, 2) = number of blocks at position (2, 2)
- B(3, 3) = number of blocks at position (3, 3)
- B(4, 4) = number of blocks at position (4, 4)

From the problem, we know that:

1. B(1, 1) < 10
2. B(1, 1) = 2 * B(2, 1) = 2 * B(2, 2)
3. B(4, 4) = 2 * B(3, 3)
4. B(1, 1) > B(3, 3) + B(4, 4)
5. The robot moves a total of 18 blocks.

The robot moves diagonally from position (5, 5) to position (1, 1), moving all blocks in its path. This means that the robot moves all blocks at positions (4, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), and (1, 1). 

So, the total number of blocks moved by the robot is B(4, 4) + B(3, 3) + B(2, 2) + B(2, 1) + B(1, 1) = 18.

Since B(1, 1) = 2 * B(2, 1) = 2 * B(2, 2) and B(4, 4) = 2 * B(3, 3), we can rewrite the equation as B(4, 4) + B(4, 4)/2 + B(1, 1)/2 + B(1, 1)/2 + B(1, 1) = 18.

Simplifying this gives 2 * B(4, 4) + 2 * B(1, 1) = 18.

From the fourth condition, we know that B(1, 1) > B(3, 3) + B(4, 4) = B(4, 4) + B(4, 4)/2 = 3/2 * B(4, 4).

So, B(1, 1) > 3/2 * B(4, 4).

Substituting this into the equation gives 2 * B(4, 4) + 2 * 3/2 * B(4, 4) = 18.

Solving this gives B(4, 4) = 4.

So, there were initially 4 blocks at position (4, 4).

The answer is /boxed/4.

{'statement': 'We have a 3x3 board of positive integers. The rule of this board is that all three numbers that are in a row or a column must be in order. This means either first < second < third number or first > second >  third number in each row or column. The numbers in the first row are Z, 2, 5, second row are 12, 9, Y and the third row are X, 12, 9, where X, Y, and Z are 3 unknown numbers. If Y is an even number and X is twice Y, then what is X + Y + Z?', 'type': 'Constraint Satisfaction', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 25}
Let's solve this step by step:

1. The numbers in the first row are Z, 2, 5. Since the numbers in each row must be in order, Z must be less than 2 or greater than 5. So, Z can be any positive integer that is not between 2 and 5.

2. The numbers in the second row are 12, 9, Y. Since the numbers in each row must be in order, Y must be less than 9. So, Y can be any positive integer that is less than 9.

3. The numbers in the third row are X, 12, 9. Since the numbers in each row must be in order, X must be greater than 12. So, X can be any positive integer that is greater than 12.

4. We know that Y is an even number. So, Y can be 2, 4, 6, or 8.

5. We know that X is twice Y. So, if Y is 2, then X is 4. But X must be greater than 12, so Y cannot be 2. If Y is 4, then X is 8. But X must be greater than 12, so Y cannot be 4. If Y is 6, then X is 12. But X must be greater than 12, so Y cannot be 6. If Y is 8, then X is 16. This satisfies the condition that X is greater than 12. So, Y is 8 and X is 16.

6. Since Z must be less than 2 or greater than 5, and all numbers are positive integers, Z can be 1 or any integer greater than 5. But since Z is in the same column as 12 and 16, Z must be less than 12. So, Z can be 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11. But since Z is in the same column as 9 and 8, Z must be greater than 9. So, Z is 10, 11. But since all numbers in each column must be in order, Z must be less than 9. So, Z is 10.

7. So, X + Y + Z = 16 + 8 + 10 = 34.

The answer is /boxed/34.

{'statement': 'I am a 4 digit number. My rightmost digit is not divisible by 2.  The sum of my digits is 20, and all my digits are in strictly decreasing order from left to right. Also at least one of my digits is 4 times one of my other digits, and the difference between my 2 middle digits is more than 3. What number am I?', 'type': 'Constraint Satisfaction', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 9821}
Let's denote the digits of the 4-digit number from left to right as a, b, c, and d. 

1. The rightmost digit is not divisible by 2. This means that d is either 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9.

2. The sum of the digits is 20. This means that a + b + c + d = 20.

3. All the digits are in strictly decreasing order from left to right. This means that a > b > c > d.

4. At least one of the digits is 4 times one of the other digits. This means that a = 4b or a = 4c or a = 4d or b = 4c or b = 4d or c = 4d.

5. The difference between the 2 middle digits is more than 3. This means that |b - c| > 3.

From these clues, we can start by looking at the possible values for a. Since a > b > c > d and a + b + c + d = 20, a can not be less than 6. Also, since a is 4 times one of the other digits, a can be 8 or 4. But if a is 4, then b, c, and d must be 1, which contradicts with the condition that all digits are different. So, a = 8.

Then, since a = 8 and a is 4 times one of the other digits, one of the other digits must be 2. Since a > b > c > d, this digit can be b or c. But if b = 2, then |b - c| can not be more than 3, because c must be less than 2. So, c = 2.

Now, we have a = 8, c = 2, and a + b + c + d = 20. So, b + d = 20 - 8 - 2 = 10. Since a > b > c > d, b can be 7, 6, or 5. But if b is 7, then d must be 3, which contradicts with the condition that d is not divisible by 2. If b is 6, then d must be 4, which contradicts with the condition that a > b > c > d. So, b = 5 and d = 5.

So, the 4-digit number is 8525.

The answer is /boxed/8525.

{'statement': "There are 5 baskets of candy, marked X, Y, Z, T, and E. X has 8 candies, Y has 5, Z has 23, T has 12, and E has 20 candies in it. Each basket belongs to Alice, Bobby, Charlie, Denise, or Eliot, and no two people share the same basket. If Bobby wants to split his candies between 5 people, he would have 3 candies remaining. Eliot has less candies than Alice, and Alice has more candies than Denise. Charlie can’t split her candies equally between 4 people, and she has fewer candies than Eliot, but if she doubles the number of her candies then she would have more candies than Eliot. What would we get if we subtract the sum of the number of candies that Bobby and Charlie have from the sum of Eliot's and Alice’s candies?", 'type': 'Constraint Satisfaction', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 0}
Let's denote the number of candies in each person's basket as follows:

Bobby = B
Eliot = E
Alice = A
Denise = D
Charlie = C

From the problem, we know that:

1. B = 5k + 3 for some integer k (Bobby wants to split his candies between 5 people, he would have 3 candies remaining)
2. E < A (Eliot has less candies than Alice)
3. A > D (Alice has more candies than Denise)
4. C ≠ 4m for any integer m (Charlie can’t split her candies equally between 4 people)
5. C < E (Charlie has fewer candies than Eliot)
6. 2C > E (if Charlie doubles the number of her candies then she would have more candies than Eliot)

From the first condition, we know that Bobby's basket could be Y or T. But since Y is less than 8 and T is more than 8, Bobby's basket must be T (12 candies).

From the fourth condition, we know that Charlie's basket could be X or Y. But since Charlie has fewer candies than Eliot (fifth condition) and Eliot has less candies than Alice (second condition), Charlie's basket must be X (8 candies).

From the second and third conditions, we know that Alice's basket could be Z or E. But since Alice has more candies than Denise and Denise's basket could be Y, Z, or E, Alice's basket must be Z (23 candies).

From the fifth and sixth conditions, we know that Eliot's basket could be Y or E. But since Eliot has less candies than Alice and Alice's basket is Z, Eliot's basket must be E (20 candies).

Finally, since Denise's basket could be Y or Z and Z is Alice's basket, Denise's basket must be Y (5 candies).

So, the sum of the number of candies that Bobby and Charlie have is 12 + 8 = 20, and the sum of Eliot's and Alice’s candies is 20 + 23 = 43.

Subtracting the sum of the number of candies that Bobby and Charlie have from the sum of Eliot's and Alice’s candies, we get 43 - 20 = 23.

The answer is /boxed/23.

1. We know that Emma was born 2 days before Andy. So, Andy can't be born on 11th or 12th, because then Emma's birthday would fall before 11th. So, Andy's possible birth dates are 13th, 14th, or 15th.



2. Blake was born 2 days before Danny. So, Danny can't be born on 11th or 12th, because then Blake's birthday would fall before 11th. So, Danny's possible birth dates are 13th, 14th, or 15th.



3. Emma’s birthday is before Blake’s birthday. So, Blake can't be born on 11th, 12th, or 13th, because then Emma's birthday would fall before 11th. So, Blake's possible birth dates are 14th or 15th.



4. The number of days between Danny’s birthday and Conor’s birthday is less than the number of days between Blake’s and Connor’s birthday. This means Conor's birthday is after Danny's but before Blake's. So, Conor's possible birth dates are 13th or 14th.

5. The fourth row has the numbers 8, 5, and 9. Since the numbers in a row must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from left to right or right to left, the fourth number in the fourth row must be 9.

6. The second column has the numbers 2, 6, 8, and 5. Since the numbers in a column must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from top down or down up, the second number in the second column must be 8.

7. The third column has the numbers 2, 6, 7, and 9. Since the numbers in a column must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from top down or down up, the second number in the third column must be 9.

8. The fourth column has the numbers 4, 6, 8, and 9. Since the numbers in a column must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from top down or down up, the second number in the fourth column must be 9.

9. The number in the two diagonals must be strictly increasing or decreasing. The first diagonal has the numbers 4, 6, 7, and 9. The second diagonal has the numbers 4, 8, 6, and 9. So, all the numbers in the diagonals are already determined.

So, the final board is:

4 2 2 4
6 8 9 6
8 6 7 8
5 5 9 9

The sum of all the numbers in the board is 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 91.

The answer is /boxed/91.

{'statement': 'There’s a line to enter a cinema. There are 4 people between Bob and Alex. Chad’s index in the line is 1 after Bob’s, he’s standing right behind Bob, considering the order of people left to right. Frank is right behind Alex. Sam is right in front of Bob. There are 2 people between Sam and Frank. If Bob is in the 7th person in the line, counting left to right, what is the number of Alex?', 'type': 'Constraint Satisfaction', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 2}
Let's solve this step by step:

1. Bob is the 7th person in the line.
2. There are 4 people between Bob and Alex. So, Alex is either the 2nd person or the 12th person in the line.
3. Chad is right behind Bob, so Chad is the 8th person in the line.
4. Frank is right behind Alex. So, if Alex was the 2nd person, Frank would be the 3rd person. But, there are 2 people between Sam and Frank, and Sam is right in front of Bob (6th person). So, Frank can't be the 3rd person. Therefore, Alex must be the 12th person, and Frank is the 13th person.

So, the number of Alex in the line is 12.

The answer is /boxed/12.

{'statement': "David has 2 rectangular books, book A and book B. He also has a thread and he realizes the length of his thread is equal to the height of book A plus the width of book A. He also notes that the length of the thread is equal to either the width of book A plus height of book B or height of book A plus width of book B. He knows the Height of book A is 12 cm, the width of book A is longer than the height of book B, and the surface area of book A is 96cm^2. The surface area of book A is also equal to the surface area of book B multiplied by 3. What's the length of Book B's height?", 'type': 'Constraint Satisfaction', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 4}
Let's denote the height of book A as Ha, the width of book A as Wa, the height of book B as Hb, and the width of book B as Wb.

From the problem, we know that:

1. Ha = 12 cm (the height of book A is 12 cm)
2. Ha * Wa = 96 cm^2 (the surface area of book A is 96 cm^2)
3. Wa > Hb (the width of book A is longer than the height of book B)
4. Ha * Wa = Hb * Wb * 3 (the surface area of book A is equal to the surface area of book B multiplied by 3)
5. Ha + Wa = Hb + Wa or Ha + Wa = Ha + Wb (the length of the thread is equal to either the width of book A plus height of book B or height of book A plus width of book B)

From the second condition, we can find that Wa = 96 cm^2 / Ha = 96 cm^2 / 12 cm = 8 cm.

From the fourth condition, we can find that Hb = Ha * Wa / (3 * Wb) = 12 cm * 8 cm / (3 * Wb).

From the fifth condition, we can find that Hb = Ha = 12 cm or Wb = Wa = 8 cm.

Since Wa > Hb, we know that Wb = Wa = 8 cm is not possible. So, Hb = Ha = 12 cm.

So, the height of book B is 12 cm.

The answer is /boxed/12.0.

{'statement': "Sam is scheduling his boss’s meetings. Each meeting is 1 hour long. Person C is scheduled right before person B, Person D is scheduled for the slot after Person A, and D’s meeting is later than C’s meeting time. Person A and person B’s meeting times are 4 hours apart.If Person B is the 10th person to meet with Sam's boss today, what is Person A's position in the list of meetings for Sam's boss today?", 'type': 'Constraint Satisfaction', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 14}
Let's denote the meeting times of persons A, B, C, and D as a, b, c, and d respectively.

From the problem, we know that:

1. Person C is scheduled right before person B. This means that c = b - 1.
2. Person D is scheduled for the slot after Person A. This means that d = a + 1.
3. D’s meeting is later than C’s meeting time. This means that d > c.
4. Person A and person B’s meeting times are 4 hours apart. This means that a = b - 4.
5. Person B is the 10th person to meet with Sam's boss today. This means that b = 10.

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 1, we know that c = b - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.

From equation 4, we know that a = b - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6.

From equation 2, we know that d = a + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Now, let's check if these values satisfy equation 3 (d > c). We have d = 7 and c = 9. So, d is not greater than c, which contradicts equation 3. 

This means that our assumption that Person D is scheduled for the slot after Person A is incorrect. Instead, Person D must be scheduled for the slot after Person B. 

So, let's revise equation 2 to d = b + 1. Now, we have d = b + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11.

Now, let's check if these values satisfy equation 3 (d > c). We have d = 11 and c = 9. So, d is greater than c, which satisfies equation 3. 

So, Person A's position in the list of meetings for Sam's boss today is 6.

The answer is /boxed/6.

{'statement': 'We have a 4x4 grid of numbers greater than 1 and less than 13. We know that the numbers in a row, column, and the two diagonals must be consecutive, meaning either first > second > third> fourth or first < second < third < fourth in each row, column or diagonal. Below is the current state of the board. If a grid is marked as X, then the number in that position is masked, and it’s our task to determine the number.\n\nX X 5 9\nX 4 8 X\n5 X 10 X\n6 8 X X\n\nWhat is the sum of all the numbers in the board after determining all the numbers in the X positions?', 'type': 'Constraint Satisfaction', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 114}
Let's solve this step by step:

First, let's look at the third column. We know that the numbers in a column must be consecutive. The numbers in the third column are 5, 8, 10, and X. The only number that can be consecutive with 5, 8, and 10 is 7. So, the number in the fourth row of the third column is 7.

Next, let's look at the fourth row. We know that the numbers in a row must be consecutive. The numbers in the fourth row are 6, 8, 7, and X. The only number that can be consecutive with 6, 8, and 7 is 9. So, the number in the fourth row of the fourth column is 9.

Now, let's look at the second row. We know that the numbers in a row must be consecutive. The numbers in the second row are X, 4, 8, and X. The only numbers that can be consecutive with 4 and 8 are 5 and 6. So, the number in the second row of the first column is 5 and the number in the second row of the fourth column is 6.

Next, let's look at the first row. We know that the numbers in a row must be consecutive. The numbers in the first row are X, X, 5, and 9. The only numbers that can be consecutive with 5 and 9 are 6 and 7. So, the number in the first row of the first column is 6 and the number in the first row of the second column is 7.

Finally, let's look at the third row. We know that the numbers in a row must be consecutive. The numbers in the third row are 5, X, 10, and X. The only numbers that can be consecutive with 5 and 10 are 6 and 7. So, the number in the third row of the second column is 6 and the number in the third row of the fourth column is 7.

So, the final board is:

6 7 5 9
5 4 8 6
5 6 10 7
6 8 7 9

The sum of all the numbers in the board is 6 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 5 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 10 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 9 = 95.

The answer is /boxed/95.
