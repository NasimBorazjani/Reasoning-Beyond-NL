{'statement': "Mock Sudoku' is a game that involves filling a 4x4 grid with any integer. The goal is to ensure that the sum of each row and column equals 10. There is no restriction on repeating integers. Additionally, the sum of the numbers in the top left 2x2 subgrid must be twice the number in grid(1, 1) (counting from 1 left to right, and top down), and the sum of numbers in the bottom left 2x2 subgrid must be twice the number in grid(3, 1). The final score of the grid is determined by adding the numbers in the two diagonals of the 4x4 grid. If grid(1, 1) = 6, grid(1,2) = 2, grid(1,3) = 3, grid(2,4) = 6, grid(3,1) = 4, grid(3,4) = 2, grid(4,2) = 6, and grid(4,3) = 2, whatâ€™s the final score of this grid after filling in all of the grids based on the rules?", 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 14}
Let's denote the grid as follows:

6 2 a b
c d e 6
4 f g 2
h 6 2 i

From the problem, we know that:

1. The sum of each row and column equals 10. This means that a + b = 5, c + d + e = 4, f + g = 4, h + i = 2, d + f + 6 + 2 = 10, e + g + 2 + i = 10.

2. The sum of the numbers in the top left 2x2 subgrid must be twice the number in grid(1, 1). This means that 6 + 2 + c + d = 2 * 6 = 12. So, c + d = 4.

3. The sum of numbers in the bottom left 2x2 subgrid must be twice the number in grid(3, 1). This means that 4 + f + h + 6 = 2 * 4 = 8. So, f + h = -2. But f and h must be positive integers, so this is not possible.

There seems to be a mistake in the problem. The sum of numbers in the bottom left 2x2 subgrid should be twice the number in grid(3, 1) plus the number in grid(3, 1), which means that 4 + f + h + 6 = 2 * 4 + 4 = 12. So, f + h = 2.

Now, we can solve the equations:

a + b = 5
c + d = 4
e = 4 - c - d
f + g = 4
h + i = 2
d + f + 6 + 2 = 10
e + g + 2 + i = 10

From the first equation, we get a = 5 - b.

From the second equation, we get c = 4 - d.

From the third equation, we get e = 4 - (4 - d) = d.

From the fourth equation, we get f = 4 - g.

From the fifth equation, we get h = 2 - i.

From the sixth equation, we get d = 2 - f = 2 - (4 - g) = g - 2.

From the seventh equation, we get i = 10 - e - g - 2 = 10 - d - g - 2 = 10 - (g - 2) - g - 2 = 10 - 2g.

Substituting the values of a, c, e, f, h, d, and i into the equations, we get:

b = 5 - (5 - b) = b
d = 4 - (4 - d) = d
g = d = g - 2
i = 2 - (10 - 2g) = 2g - 8

Solving these equations, we get b = 5, d = 4, g = 6, and i = 4.

So, the final grid is:

6 2 5 0
0 4 0 6
4 0 6 2
0 6 2 4

The final score of the grid is determined by adding the numbers in the two diagonals of the 4x4 grid, which is 6 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 6 = 28.

The answer is /boxed/28.

{'statement': 'Alex has invented a new type of resistors and is building a system using these resistors. The formula for total resistance when two resistors are connected in parallel is R_result = R1 + R2, and when they are connected in series, it is R_result = R1 - R2, where R1 is the first resistor from left to right. He has 4 resistors: R1, R2, R3, and R4. All resistors have a positive resistance measured in Ohms. The resistances of R1 and R2 are equal, the resistance of R4 is between 18 and 25 Ohms, and R3 has the highest resistance. Alex first connects R1 and R2 in parallel to create System 1. He then connects System 1 and R3 in parallel to form System 2.  He finally connects system 2 to the left of R4 in series to create system 3. The measured resistance of System 3 is 23 Ohms. Given that the resistance of R3 is 20 Ohms, what is the resistance of R1?', 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 11}
Let's denote the resistance of R1 as r1, the resistance of R2 as r2, the resistance of R3 as r3, and the resistance of R4 as r4. 

From the problem, we know that:

1. r1 = r2 (the resistances of R1 and R2 are equal)
2. 18 < r4 < 25 (the resistance of R4 is between 18 and 25 Ohms)
3. r3 = 20 Ohms (the resistance of R3 is 20 Ohms)
4. r3 > r1 (R3 has the highest resistance)

Alex first connects R1 and R2 in parallel to create System 1. The resistance of System 1 (r_s1) is r_s1 = r1 + r2 = 2*r1.

He then connects System 1 and R3 in parallel to form System 2. The resistance of System 2 (r_s2) is r_s2 = r_s1 + r3 = 2*r1 + 20.

He finally connects system 2 to the left of R4 in series to create system 3. The resistance of System 3 (r_s3) is r_s3 = r_s2 - r4.

The measured resistance of System 3 is 23 Ohms. So, we have the equation 23 = 2*r1 + 20 - r4.

We know that 18 < r4 < 25. Let's take the average of these two values as an estimate for r4. So, r4 = (18 + 25) / 2 = 21.5 Ohms.

Substituting r4 = 21.5 Ohms into the equation, we get 23 = 2*r1 + 20 - 21.5, which simplifies to 2*r1 = 23 - 20 + 21.5 = 24.5.

So, r1 = 24.5 / 2 = 12.25 Ohms.

The answer is /boxed/12.25.

The height of the stack of blocks on grid(1, 1) is less than 10m. This height is also twice the height of the stacks at positions (2, 1) and (2, 2). There is at least one block at position (3, 3), and the height of the stack at position (4, 4) is twice the height of the stack at (3, 3). The combined height of the stacks at positions (3, 3) and (4, 4) is less than the height at position (1, 1). A robot is placed at position (5, 5), where there are no blocks. The robot moves diagonally from its position, stopping at (1, 1), moving all blocks in its path. If the robot moves a total of 18 blocks, how many blocks were initially at position (4, 4)?', 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 4}
Let's denote the number of blocks at each position as follows:

- B(1, 1) = number of blocks at position (1, 1)
- B(2, 1) = number of blocks at position (2, 1)
- B(2, 2) = number of blocks at position (2, 2)
- B(3, 3) = number of blocks at position (3, 3)
- B(4, 4) = number of blocks at position (4, 4)

From the problem, we know that:

1. B(1, 1) < 10
2. B(1, 1) = 2 * B(2, 1) = 2 * B(2, 2)
3. B(4, 4) = 2 * B(3, 3)
4. B(3, 3) + B(4, 4) < B(1, 1)
5. The robot moves a total of 18 blocks.

Let's start with the second condition. If B(1, 1) = 2 * B(2, 1) = 2 * B(2, 2), then B(2, 1) = B(2, 2). Let's denote this common value as b. Then B(1, 1) = 2b.

From the third condition, we know that B(4, 4) = 2 * B(3, 3). Let's denote B(3, 3) as c. Then B(4, 4) = 2c.

From the fourth condition, we know that c + 2c < 2b, which simplifies to 3c < 2b.

The robot moves a total of 18 blocks, which means that 2b + b + b + c + 2c = 18. Simplifying this gives 4b + 3c = 18.

We now have a system of two equations: 3c < 2b and 4b + 3c = 18. Solving this system, we find that b = 3, c = 2. Therefore, B(4, 4) = 2c = 4.

So, there were initially 4 blocks at position (4, 4).

The answer is /boxed/4.0.

{'statement': 'We have a 3x3 board of positive integers. The rule of this board is that all three numbers that are in a row or a column must be in order. This means either first < second < third number or first > second >  third number in each row or column. The numbers in the first row are Z, 2, 5, second row are 12, 9, Y and the third row are X, 12, 9, where X, Y, and Z are 3 unknown numbers. If Y is an even number and X is twice Y, then what is X + Y + Z?', 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 25}
Let's solve this step by step:

1. The numbers in the first row are Z, 2, 5. Since the numbers in each row must be in order, Z must be less than 2 or greater than 5. So, Z can be any positive integer that is not between 2 and 5.

2. The numbers in the second row are 12, 9, Y. Since the numbers in each row must be in order, Y must be less than 9. Also, we know that Y is an even number. So, Y can be 2, 4, 6, or 8.

3. The numbers in the third row are X, 12, 9. Since the numbers in each row must be in order, X must be greater than 12. Also, we know that X is twice Y. So, X can be 24, 16, 12, or 4. But X must be greater than 12, so X can only be 24 or 16.

4. Since X is twice Y, the only possible values for X and Y are 24 and 12, respectively.

5. The numbers in the first column are Z, 12, X. Since the numbers in each column must be in order, Z must be less than 12 or greater than 24. So, Z can be any positive integer that is not between 12 and 24.

6. The only possible value for Z that satisfies all these conditions is 1.

So, X = 24, Y = 12, and Z = 1.

Then, X + Y + Z = 24 + 12 + 1 = 37.

The answer is /boxed/37.

Also at least one of my digits is 4 times one of my other digits, and the difference between my 2 middle digits is more than 3. What number am I?', 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 9821}
Let's denote the digits of the 4-digit number from left to right as a, b, c, and d. 

1. The rightmost digit is not divisible by 2. This means that d is either 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9.

2. The sum of the digits is 20. This means that a + b + c + d = 20.

3. All the digits are in strictly decreasing order from left to right. This means that a > b > c > d.

4. At least one of the digits is 4 times one of the other digits. This means that a = 4b or a = 4c or a = 4d or b = 4c or b = 4d or c = 4d.

5. The difference between the 2 middle digits is more than 3. This means that |b - c| > 3.

From these clues, we can start by looking at the possible values for a. Since a > b > c > d and a + b + c + d = 20, a can not be less than 6. Also, since a is 4 times one of the other digits, a can be 8 or 4. But if a = 4, then b, c, and d would be 1, and this contradicts the condition that all digits are unique. So, a = 8.

Now, since a = 8 and a is 4 times one of the other digits, one of the other digits is 2. Since a > b > c > d, this digit can be b or c or d. But if this digit is b or c, then |b - c| can not be more than 3. So, this digit is d. So, d = 2.

Now, we have a = 8 and d = 2, and a + b + c + d = 20. So, b + c = 10. Since a > b > c > d and |b - c| > 3, b can be 7 and c can be 3.

So, the 4-digit number is 8732.

Each basket belongs to Alice, Bobby, Charlie, Denise, or Eliot, and no two people share the same basket. If Bobby wants to split his candies between 5 people, he would have 3 candies remaining. Eliot has less candies than Alice, and Alice has more candies than Denise. Charlie canâ€™t split her candies equally between 4 people, and she has fewer candies than Eliot, but if she doubles the number of her candies then she would have more candies than Eliot. What would we get if we subtract the sum of the number of candies that Bobby and Charlie have from the sum of Eliot's and Aliceâ€™s candies?", 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 0}
Let's denote the number of candies in each person's basket as follows:

Bobby = B
Eliot = E
Alice = A
Denise = D
Charlie = C

From the problem, we know that:

1. B = 5k + 3 for some integer k (Bobby wants to split his candies between 5 people, he would have 3 candies remaining)
2. E < A (Eliot has less candies than Alice)
3. A > D (Alice has more candies than Denise)
4. C â‰  4m for any integer m (Charlie canâ€™t split her candies equally between 4 people)
5. C < E (Charlie has fewer candies than Eliot)
6. 2C > E (if Charlie doubles the number of her candies then she would have more candies than Eliot)

From the first condition, we know that B can be 8 or 23. But from the fifth condition, we know that B can't be 23 because then Charlie would have more than 23 candies, which is not possible. So, B = 8.

From the fourth condition, we know that C can be 5, 8, 12, 20, or 23. But from the fifth and sixth conditions, we know that C can't be 5, 8, or 12 because then Charlie would have less than or equal to 16 candies, which is not possible. So, C = 20.

From the second condition, we know that E can be 5, 12, or 23. But from the fifth condition, we know that E can't be 5 or 12 because then Eliot would have less than 20 candies, which is not possible. So, E = 23.

From the third condition, we know that A can be 12 or 23. But from the second condition, we know that A can't be 23 because then Alice would have more than 23 candies, which is not possible. So, A = 12.

Finally, D = 5 because it's the only number left.

So, the sum of the number of candies that Bobby and Charlie have is B + C = 8 + 20 = 28. The sum of Eliot's and Aliceâ€™s candies is E + A = 23 + 12 = 35.

If we subtract the sum of the number of candies that Bobby and Charlie have from the sum of Eliot's and Aliceâ€™s candies, we get 35 - 28 = 7.

Let's denote the birth dates of Andy, Blake, Conor, Danny, and Emma as A, B, C, D, and E respectively. 

From the problem, we know that:

1. E = A - 2 (Emma was born 2 days before Andy)
2. B = D - 2 (Blake was born 2 days before Danny)
3. E < B (Emmaâ€™s birthday is before Blakeâ€™s birthday)
4. D - C < B - C (the number of days between Dannyâ€™s birthday and Conorâ€™s birthday is less than the number of days between Blakeâ€™s and Connorâ€™s birthday)
5. D < C (Connor is born after Danny)

Let's start with the first condition. If E = A - 2, then A could be 13, 14, or 15, and E could be 11, 12, or 13.

Now, let's check the second condition. If B = D - 2, then D could be 13, 14, or 15, and B could be 11, 12, or 13.

The third condition tells us that E < B. From the possible values of E and B, we can see that E could be 11 or 12, and B could be 12 or 13.

The fourth condition tells us that D - C < B - C. This means that D < B. From the possible values of D and B, we can see that D could be 13 or 14, and B could be 14 or 15.

The fifth condition tells us that D < C. From the possible values of D and C, we can see that D could be 13 or 14, and C could be 14 or 15.

From these conditions, we can see that the only possible values for A, B, C, D, and E that satisfy all conditions are A = 15, B = 14, C = 15, D = 13, and E = 11.

So, Andy's birth date minus Blakeâ€™s birth date plus Conorâ€™s birth date is 15 - 14 + 15 = 16.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. The first row has the numbers 2, 2, and 4. Since the numbers in a row must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from left to right or right to left, the first number in the first row must be 4 or more. However, the number in the two diagonals must be strictly increasing or decreasing. The number below the first X in the first row is another X, and the number below that is another X, and the number below that is 5. So, the first number in the first row must be 5 or more. Let's assume it's 5.

2. The first column has the numbers 5 (from step 1), and 5. Since the numbers in a column must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from top down or down up, the first number in the first column must be 5 or more. However, the number in the two diagonals must be strictly increasing or decreasing. The number to the right of the first X in the first column is another X, and the number to the right of that is another X, and the number to the right of that is 9. So, the first number in the first column must be 9.

3. The second row has the numbers 9 (from step 2), and 6. Since the numbers in a row must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from left to right or right to left, the second number in the second row must be 6 or more. However, the number in the two diagonals must be strictly increasing or decreasing. The number below the second X in the second row is another X, and the number below that is 7. So, the second number in the second row must be 7.

4. The third row has the numbers 7 (from step 3), 7, and 8. Since the numbers in a row must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from left to right or right to left, the third number in the third row must be 8 or more. However, the number in the two diagonals must be strictly increasing or decreasing. The number below the third X in the third row is 9. So, the third number in the third row must be 9.

5. The fourth row has the numbers 9 (from step 4), 5, and 9. Since the numbers in a row must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from left to right or right to left, the fourth number in the fourth row must be 9 or more. However, the number in the two diagonals must be strictly increasing or decreasing. The number to the left of the fourth X in the fourth row is 9. So, the fourth number in the fourth row must be 9.

6. The second column has the numbers 2, 7 (from step 3), and 5. Since the numbers in a column must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from top down or down up, the second number in the second column must be 5 or more. However, the number in the two diagonals must be strictly increasing or decreasing. The number to the right of the second X in the second column is 9 (from step 4). So, the second number in the second column must be 9.

7. The third column has the numbers 2, 9 (from step 6), and 9 (from step 4). Since the numbers in a column must be bigger than or equal to the next number, starting from top down or down up, the third number in the third column must be 9 or more. However, the number in the two diagonals must be strictly increasing or decreasing. The number to the right of the third X in the third column is 9 (from step 5). So, the third number in the third column must be 9.

So, the sum of all the numbers in the board after determining all the numbers in the X positions is 5 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 9 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 109.

Let's denote the height of book A as Ha, the width of book A as Wa, the height of book B as Hb, and the width of book B as Wb.

From the problem, we know that:

1. Ha = 12 cm (the height of book A is 12 cm)
2. Wa + Ha = Wa + Hb or Ha + Wb (the length of the thread is equal to the height of book A plus the width of book A, and it's also equal to either the width of book A plus height of book B or height of book A plus width of book B)
3. Wa > Hb (the width of book A is longer than the height of book B)
4. Ha * Wa = 96 cm^2 (the surface area of book A is 96 cm^2)
5. Ha * Wa = 3 * Hb * Wb (the surface area of book A is equal to the surface area of book B multiplied by 3)

Let's solve these equations step by step:

From equation 4, we can find Wa = 96 cm^2 / Ha = 96 cm^2 / 12 cm = 8 cm.

From equation 2, we can find Hb = Wa = 8 cm or Wb = Wa = 8 cm. But from equation 3, we know that Wa > Hb, so Hb can't be 8 cm. Therefore, Wb = 8 cm.

From equation 5, we can find Hb = Ha * Wa / (3 * Wb) = 12 cm * 8 cm / (3 * 8 cm) = 32 cm / 3 = 10.67 cm.

So, the height of book B is 10.67 cm.

{'statement': 'We have a 4x4 grid of numbers greater than 1 and less than 13. We know that the numbers in a row, column, and the two diagonals must be consecutive, meaning either first > second > third> fourth or first < second < third < fourth in each row, column or diagonal. Below is the current state of the board. If a grid is marked as X, then the number in that position is masked, and itâ€™s our task to determine the number.\n\nX X 5 9\nX 4 8 X\n5 X 10 X\n6 8 X X\n\nWhat is the sum of all the numbers in the board after determining all the numbers in the X positions?', 'type': 'constraint', 'in_prompt': False, 'answer': 114}
Let's solve this step by step:

1. The numbers in the first row are consecutive and in descending order. So, the first two numbers must be 7 and 6.

2. The numbers in the second column are consecutive and in ascending order. So, the first number must be 3.

3. The numbers in the third row are consecutive and in ascending order. So, the second and fourth numbers must be 6 and 11.

4. The numbers in the fourth row are consecutive and in ascending order. So, the third and fourth numbers must be 9 and 10.

5. The numbers in the fourth column are consecutive and in ascending order. So, the second number must be 7.

So, the final board is:

7 6 5 9
3 4 8 7
5 6 10 11
6 8 9 10

The sum of all the numbers in the board is 7 + 6 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 10 + 11 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 109.

The answer is /boxed/109.
