When I was half my current age, my father was 30. When I was ⅓ my current age, my mother was 25. And when I was ⅙ of my current age, my sister was 7. If the sum of my age, my sister’s age, my father’s age, and my mother’s age is 116, then how old am I now?

Let's denote the current ages as follows:

- My age = x
- My father's age = f
- My mother's age = m
- My sister's age = s

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. When I was half my current age, my father was 30. So, f = x/2 + 30
2. When I was ⅓ my current age, my mother was 25. So, ⅔ * x years ago my mother was 25. m = ⅔ * x + 25
3. When I was ⅙ of my current age, my sister was 7. So, s = x * 5/6 + 7
4. The sum of all our ages is 116. So, x + f + m + s = 116

Now, we can substitute equations 1, 2, and 3 into equation 4:

x + (x/2 + 30) + (x * 2/3 + 25) + (x * 5/6 + 7) = 116
Multiply all terms by 6 to get rid of the fractions:
6x + 3x + 180 + 4x + 150 + 5x + 42 = 696
Combine like terms:
18x + 372 = 696
Subtract 372 from both sides:
18x = 324
Divide both sides by 12:
x = 18

So, I am 18 years old now.

The answer is /boxed/18.


We have 200 apples that we splitted between 4 salespeople (called X, Y, Z, and T) to sell at a fair. The sum of apples we gave Y and Z is 10 less than the sum we gave to X and T. In the fair X and Z sold all their apples; Y had to throw out 10 of the apples we gave him, and T threw out 5. The sum of the number of apples that T and Y sold is 5 less than twice the number of apples Z sold. X and Y set the price of each of their apples equivalent to 1/10th the number of apples they were each given, in dollars. Z set the price of each of his apples equivalent to 1/8 times the number he received, and T’s price for each apple was twice Z’s price. And T’s price for each apple is $3 more expensive than X’s price. What is the total money that the 4 salespeople made from selling the apples in the fair?

Let's denote the number of apples given to each salesperson as follows: X = x, Y = y, Z = z, and T = t. 

From the problem, we know that:

1) x + y + z + t = 200 (total number of apples)
2) y + z = x + t (sum of apples given to Y and Z is 10 less than the sum given to X and T)
3) t + y - 15 = 2z - 5 (sum of the number of apples that T and Y sold is 5 less than twice the number of apples Z sold)

We also know that the price of each apple is set as follows:

4) X's price = x/10
5) Y's price = y/10
6) Z's price = z/8
7) T's price = z/8 * 2 = z/4 

And we know that T's price is $3 more expensive than X's price, so:

8) z/4 = x/10 + 3
=> z = 4x/10 + 12 = 2x/5 + 12

Substitute z = 2x/5 + 12 into equations 1), 2) and 3) we get:

1') x + y + 2x/5 + 12 + t = 200 
2') y + 2x/5 + 12 = x + t 
3') t + y - 15 = 2*2x/5 + 24 - 5 

Solving these equations, we get x = 70, y = 60, z = 40, t = 30.

The total money that the 4 salespeople made from selling the apples in the fair is:

X's total = x * x/10 = 70 * 70/10 = 490
Y's total = (y - 10) * y/10 = 50 * 60/10 = 300
Z's total = z * z/8 = 40 * 40/8 = 200
T's total = (t - 5) * z/4 = 25 * 40/4 = 250

So, the total money that the 4 salespeople made from selling the apples in the fair is 490 + 300 + 200 + 250 = 1240.

The answer is /boxed/1240.


We have a list of 8 numbers. If we subtract the number at index i+2  from the i_th number, we get the number at index i+1, for i less than 7 and greater than 0, indexing from 1. If the 3rd number in the list is -2 and the last number in the list is 41, then what is the sum of all numbers in this list?

Let's denote the numbers in the list as a1, a2, a3, ..., a8. 

From the problem, we know that a3 = -2 and a8 = 41. 

We also know that for each i (1 <= i <= 6), ai - ai+2 = ai+1. 

Let's use this rule to express all numbers in terms of a1 and a2:

a3 = a1 - a2
a4 = a2 - a3 = a2 - (a1 - a2) = 2a2 - a1
a5 = a3 - a4 = a3 - (2a2 - a1) = 2a1 - 3a2
a6 = a4 - a5 = (2a2 - a1) - (2a1 - 3a2) = 5a2 - 3a1
a7 = a5 - a6 = (2a1 - 3a2) - (5a2 - 3a1) = 5a1 - 8a2
a8 = a6 - a7 = (5a2 - 3a1) - (5a1 - 8a2) = 13a2 - 8a1

We know that a3 = -2 and a8 = 41, so we have two equations:

a1 - a2 = -2
13a2 - 8a1 = 41

Solving this system of equations, we get a1 = 3 and a2 = 5.

Now we can find all the numbers in the list:

a1 = 3
a2 = 5
a3 = -2
a4 = 7
a5 = -9
a6 = 16
a7 = -25
a8 = 41

The sum of all numbers in the list is 3 + 5 + -2 + 7 + -9 + 16 + -25 + 41 = 36.

The answer is /boxed/36.


Alex, Sam, and Andy got some money as a Christmas gift. Alex deposits all of his money in a bank account with an interest rate of 20 percent for 2 years. Sam deposits his money in an account with the same interest rate, but he spends 40% of the total money he has in the account after one year and keeps the rest deposited in the bank for the 2nd year. Andy buys a laptop with some of his money for which he pays a deposit of $50, and a monthly payment of $10 for two years, and keeps the rest of the money for 2 years. By the end of the 2nd year, if Sam gives $72 to Alex, then they’d have the same amount of money; this amount would be 3 times the amount Andy has after 2 years. Alex has 48 dollars more than twice the amount Andy has by the end of the 2nd year. What is the sum of their Christmas money in the beginning?


Let's denote the initial amount of money that Alex, Sam, and Andy received as A, S, and T respectively.

According to the problem, Alex deposits all his money in a bank account with an interest rate of 20 percent for 2 years. So, by the end of the 2nd year, Alex will have A * (1 + 20/100)^2 = A * 1.44.

Sam deposits his money in an account with the same interest rate, but he spends 40% of the total money he has in the account after one year and keeps the rest deposited in the bank for the 2nd year. So, by the end of the 1st year, Sam will have S * (1 + 20/100) = S * 1.2. After spending 40% of this amount, he will have S * 1.2 * (1 - 40/100) = S * 0.72 left. This amount will then grow by 20% during the 2nd year, so by the end of the 2nd year, Sam will have S * 0.72 * (1 + 20/100) = S * 0.864.

Andy buys a laptop with some of his money for which he pays a deposit of $50, and a monthly payment of $10 for two years, and keeps the rest of the money for 2 years. So, Andy spends a total of $50 + $10 * 12 * 2 = $290 on the laptop. The rest of his money, T - $290, he keeps for 2 years. 

By the end of the 2nd year, if Sam gives $72 to Alex, then they’d have the same amount of money; this amount would be 3 times the amount Andy has after 2 years. So, we have the equation A * 1.44 + $72 = S * 0.864 - $72 = 3 * (T - $290).

Alex has 48 dollars more than twice the amount Andy has by the end of the 2nd year. So, we have the equation A * 1.44 = 2 * (T - $290) + $48.

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get A = $200, S = $500, and T = $410.

So, the sum of their Christmas money in the beginning is A + S + T = $200 + $500 + $410 = $1110.

The answer is /boxed/1110.


We have a 3x3 grid of numbers. We know that in each 2x2 subgrid of this grid, the sum of the two numbers in one diagonal equals the sum of the two other numbers in the other diagonal. We also know that the number at the center of the grid equals the number at the 3rd row and 3rd column of the grid (counting left to right, top down). Below is the grid that we have, our task is to determine the numbers in the locations marked as X

3 X X
X 7 9
2 X X

What is the sum of all the numbers marked as X on this grid?

Let's denote the unknown numbers as follows:

3 a b
c 7 9
2 d e

From the conditions given in the problem, we can form the following equations:

1) For the top left 2x2 subgrid: 3 + 7 = a + c
2) For the top right 2x2 subgrid: a + 9 = b + 7
3) For the bottom left 2x2 subgrid: c + d = 2 + 7
4) For the bottom right 2x2 subgrid: 7 + e = 9 + d
5) The number at the center equals the number at the 3rd row and 3rd column: 7 = e

From equation (5), we know that e = 7.

Substitute e = 7 into equation (4), we get d = 5.

Substitute d = 5 into equation (3), we get c = 4.

Substitute c = 4 into equation (1), we get a = 6.

Substitute a = 6 into equation (2), we get b = 8.

So, the completed grid is:

3 6 8
4 7 9
2 5 7

The sum of the numbers marked as X on this grid is 6 + 8 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 30.

The answer is /boxed/30.

Out of a deck of 52 cards, some cards are lost. We know the number of lost cards is less than half of the deck. If we deal the remaining cards among 4 people, 3 cards remain. If we deal among three people, 2 cards remain, and if we deal among 5 people, 2 cards remain. How many cards are there in the deck?


Let's denote the number of remaining cards in the deck as x. 

From the problem, we know that:

1. x > 52/2 = 26 (the number of lost cards is less than half of the deck)
2. x = 4k + 3 (if we deal the remaining cards among 4 people, 3 cards remain)
3. x = 3m + 2 (if we deal among three people, 2 cards remain)
4. x = 5n + 2 (if we deal among 5 people, 2 cards remain)

Here, k, m, and n are some integers.

We need to find a number x that satisfies all these conditions.

Let's start with the second condition. If x = 4k + 3, then x could be 3, 7, …, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, etc. 

Now, let's check which of these numbers also satisfy the third condition (x = 3m + 2). The numbers that satisfy this condition are 2, 5, …, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50 etc. 

The common numbers in these two sequences are 35 and 47. 

Finally, let's check which of these numbers also satisfy the fourth condition (x = 5n + 2). The numbers that satisfy this condition are 2, 7, …, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, etc. 

The only number that satisfies all three conditions (x = 4k + 3, x = 3m + 2, x = 5n + 2) and is more than 26 is 47. 

So, there are 47 cards in the deck.

The answer is /boxed/47.


A robot and 5 blocks are positioned on a 6x6 grid. The grid coordinates are given by the row number (counting from left to right, starting from 1) and the column number (counting from top to bottom, starting from 1). Each block occupies a single grid square, and multiple blocks can be stacked on top of each other. Block1 is located at (2, 3), Block2 at (4, 3), and Block3 at (2, 5). Block4 is in the same row as Block3 but with one column separating them. Block5 is in the same column as Block4, with one row separating it from Block1. The robot is in the 3rd column and begins moving from row 1 and stops moving at row 5. How many blocks will the robot move?

The robot will move 4 blocks.

Here's how:

First, let's identify the positions of all the blocks and the robot's path.

Block1 is at (2, 3)
Block2 is at (4, 3)
Block3 is at (2, 5)
Block4 is in the same row as Block3 but with one column separating them, so it's either at (2, 3). (2, 7) is not a valid location on the grid.
Block5 is in the same column as Block4, with one row separating it from Block1, so it's at (4, 3).(0, 3) is not a valid location on the grid.

The robot starts at (1, 3) and stops at (5, 3).

Now, let's see which blocks are in the robot's path. The robot moves along the 3rd column from row 1 to row 5. So, it will move any blocks that are in this path.

Looking at the block positions, we can see that Block1, Block2, Block4, and Block5 are in the robot's path. So, the robot will move these four blocks.

Block3, is not in the robot's path, so the robot will not move this block.

So, the robot will move 4 blocks.

The answer is /boxed/4.


We are attempting to crack a safe with a 4-digit code. We have the following clues about the pin: The second digit from the right is not divisible by 2 and it’s not divisible by 3. This digit is larger than two of the other digits in the pin. Also this digit is equal to the difference between two of the other digits in the pin. Each digit in the pin is unique. The 4-digit number is an odd number. And the sum of the first and third digits from the right is 15. What is this 4-digit number?


Let's denote the digits of the 4-digit number from left to right as a, b, c, and d. 

1. The second digit from the right is not divisible by 2 and it’s not divisible by 3. This means that the second digit from the right (c) is either 1, 5, or 7.

2. This digit (c) is larger than two of the other digits in the pin. This means that c > a and c > d or c > a and c > b or c > b and c > d.

3. Also this digit (c) is equal to the difference between two of the other digits in the pin. This means that c = |b - d| or c = |a - b| or c = |a - d|.

4. Each digit in the pin is unique. This means that a, b, c, and d are all different.

5. The 4-digit number is odd. This means that d is either 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9.

6. The sum of the first and third digits from the right is 15. This means that b and d can either be 6 and 9 or 7 and 8.

From these clues, we can start by looking at the possible values for c. Since c is larger than 2 other digits in this pin and b and d can be 6, 7, 8, or 9, c can not be 1 or 5, because then only 1 digit can be larger than c. So, c = 7.

Since all digits in this number are unique, then b or d can not be 7. Thus b and d are 6 and 9 or 9 and 6. Since d is odd, d = 9 and b = 6.

Finally, the difference between 2 of the digits is 7 and d is 9, then a must be 2.

So, the 4-digit number is 2679.

The answer is /boxed/2679.


In a street there’s only a blue, a green, a red, and a yellow house. We don’t know the order of the houses. One pet lives in each house; we know that there’s only a rabbit, a lizard, a dog, and a cat living on this street. The green and red houses are neighbors, and the house with the rabbit and the house with the lizard are next to each other, the blue house is the house after the house with the dog, and the cat lives in the blue house, and the red house is the first house. What’s the index of the house with the dog in this street, counting from 1?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. The red house is the first house.
2. The green house is next to the red house, so it must be the second house.
3. The house with the rabbit and the house with the lizard are next to each other. 
4. The cat lives in the blue house. The house with the dog is before the blue house. The blue house can be the third or the fourth house. Since the houses with the dog and cat are next to each other and the houses with the rabbit and lizard are next to each other, the blue house can not be the third house, because then the rabbit and lizard house would be the first and fourth houses. The blue house is the fourth house. Yellow house is the third house.
5. Since we know the cat is in the fourth house and the house with the dog is before the cat house, the index of the house with the dog in this street, counting from 1, is 3.

The answer is /boxed/3.

In the game of “1 to 9” there’s a 4x4 grid of numbers, each of the four overlapping 3x3 subgrids of this grid  must be filled with numbers 1 through 9, with each number appearing only once in each of 3x3 subgrids. The task of the player is to reveal the masked numbers, represented as X below. If we are given the bard below what is the sum of numbers that are currently masked in the first and fourth row?

7 6 X X
4 1 5 9
X 8 3 X
X 2 X 6


First, let's identify the numbers that are already revealed in the 3x3 subgrids. 

The top left 3x3 subgrid has the numbers 7, 6, 4, 1, 5, 8 and 3. So, the missing numbers are 2 and 9.

The top right 3x3 subgrid has the numbers 6, 5, 9, 1, 3 and 8. So, the missing numbers are 2, 4, and 7.

The bottom left 3x3 subgrid has the numbers 4, 1, 5, 8, 3, and 2. So, the missing numbers are 6, 7, and 9.

The bottom right 3x3 subgrid has the numbers 1, 5, 9, 8, 3, 6 and 2. So, the missing numbers are 4 and 7.

Now, let's look at the positions of the masked numbers.

The first masked number in the top row must be in the top left and top right 3x3 subgrids. The missing numbers in both subgrids is 2. So the first masked number must be 2.

The second masked number in the top row must be in the top right 3x3 subgrid. The missing number is either 4 or 7. 

The first masked number in the third row must be in the bottom left and top left 3x3 subgrids. The missing number in both subgrids is 9. So the first masked number must be 9.

The second masked number in the third row must be in the bottom right and top right 3x3 subgrids. The missing numbers are 4 and 7. 

The first masked number in the fourth row is in the bottom left 3x3 subgrid. The missing numbers in this subgrid are 6 and 7. 

The second masked number in the fourth row is in the bottom left and bottom right 3x3 subgrids. The missing shared number between both these subgrids is 7. So the second masked number in the fourth row must be 7.

Then the first masked number in the fourth row must be 6, as 7 already appeared once in the bottom left subgrid. And the second masked number in the third row must be 4, as 7 appeared once in the bottom right subgrid. And the second masked number in the top row must be 7 as 4 appeared once in the top right subgrid. 

So, the sum of the masked numbers in the first and fourth rows is 2 + 7 + 6 + 7 = 22.

In "Match the Range", three players each have four numbered cards. Players take turns placing a card from their set on top of a center stack of cards. This card must match, be one higher, or one lower than the top card in the center stack. If a player has multiple valid cards, they choose the card with the highest number. If none are valid, the player must take the bottom card from the center stack. Player 1 has [4, 1, 8, 2], Player 2 has [3, 3, 9, 5], and Player 3 has [8, 9, 7, 6]. The center stack starts with a single 5 card. The game starts with Player 1's turn, followed by Player 2 and Player 3. What's the total sum of all player cards after Player 1's third turn?

Let's solve this step by step:

Turn 1: Player 1 can play the 4 card. Player 1's cards are now [1, 8, 2].

Turn 2: Player 2 can play the 3 or 5 card, choosing the highest number. Player 2's cards are now [3, 3, 9].

Turn 3: Player 3 can play the 6 card. Player 3's cards are now [8, 9, 7].

Turn 4: Player 1 does not have an eligible card, taking the bottom card from the center stack. Player 1's cards are now [1, 8, 2, 5].

Turn 5: Player 2 does not have an eligible card, taking the bottom card from the center stack. Player 2's cards are now [3, 3, 9, 4].

Turn 6: Player 3 can play the 7 card. Player 3's cards are now [8, 9].

Turn 7: Player 1 can play the 8 card. Player 1's cards are now [1, 2, 5].

After Player 1's third turn, the total sum of all player cards is 8 (Player 1) + 19 (Player 2) + 17 (Player 3) = 44.

The answer is /boxed/44.


Sam starts creating a bracelet with two beads marked 'S' and 'D', her initials, with the ‘S’ bead being the first one. She uses a coin flip to decide where to add unmarked beads. If the coin lands on heads, she splits the bead chain after 'S' and if it lands on tails, she splits the chain after 'D'. She adds three beads if the length of the shorter chain is odd (one at the beginning of the first segment and two to the end of the second segment), and adds eight unmarked beads if  the length of the shorter chain is even (two at both ends of each chain segment). If she flips heads, tails, heads, heads, how many unmarked beads are between 'S' and 'D' in the end?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First flip (heads): Sam splits the chain after 'S'. The shorter chain is 'S' which has length 1 (odd), so she adds three beads: one before 'S' and two after 'D'. The chain now looks like this: 1-S-D-2-3.

2. Second flip (tails): Sam splits the chain after 'D'. The shorter chain is '2-3' which has length 2 (even), so she adds eight beads: two before '1', two after 'D', 2 before '2' and two after '3'. The chain now looks like this: 1-2-3-S-D-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11.

3. Third flip (heads): Sam splits the chain after 'S'. The shorter chain is '1-2-3-S' which has length 4 (even), so she adds eight beads: two before '1', two after 'S', 2 before 'D' and two after '11'. The chain now looks like this: 1-2-3-4-5-S-6-7-8-9-D-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19.

4. Fourth flip (heads): Sam splits the chain after 'S'. The shorter chain is '1-2-3-4-5-S' which has length 6 (even), so she adds eight beads: two before '1', two after 'S', 2 before '6' and two after '19'. The beginning of the chain now looks like this: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-S-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-D-16...

So, in the end, there are 15 - 8 + 1 = 8 unmarked beads between 'S' and 'D'.

The answer is /boxed/8.


There’s a cinema with 12 seats organized in 3 rows and 4 columns. Due to covid there’s a policy that a seat can be filled only if none of the seats right next to it in the same column or the same row are not filled. If we place a person in the seat in the second column of the first row and then start to fill the seats left to right, row by row, starting row with 1, how many people can be seated in the cinema in total?


Let's visualize the seating arrangement:

1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12

The numbers represent the seats in the cinema. The seats are filled from left to right, row by row, starting with row 1. 

We start by placing a person in the seat in the second column of the first row (seat 2). 

1 X 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12

Due to the policy, none of the seats right next to seat 2 in the same column or the same row can be filled. This means seats 1, 3, 6 cannot be filled. 

We then move to the next available seat, which is seat 4. 

1 X 3 X
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12

Again, due to the policy, none of the seats right next to seat 4 in the same column or the same row can be filled. This means seats 3, 8 cannot be filled. 

We then move to the next available seat, which is seat 5. 

1 X 3 X
X 6 7 8
9 10 11 12

Again, due to the policy, none of the seats right next to seat 5 in the same column or the same row can be filled. This means seats 6, 9 cannot be filled. 

We then move to the next available seat, which is seat 7. 

1 X 3 X
X 6 X 8
9 10 11 12

Again, due to the policy, none of the seats right next to seat 7 in the same column or the same row can be filled. This means seats 6, 8, 11 cannot be filled. 

We then move to the next available seat, which is seat 10. 

1 X 3 X
X 6 X 8
9 X 11 12

Again, due to the policy, none of the seats right next to seat 10 in the same column or the same row can be filled. This means seats 6, 9, 11 cannot be filled. 

We then move to the next available seat, which is seat 12. 

1 X 3 X
X 6 X 8
9 X 11 X

Again, due to the policy, none of the seats right next to seat 12 in the same column or the same row can be filled. This means seats 8, 11 cannot be filled. 

So, the final seating arrangement is:

1 X 3 X
X 6 X 8
9 X 11 X

Therefore, the total number of people that can be seated in the cinema is 6.

The answer is /boxed/6.


In the game "Twist It", players can push a rod right, left, or not at all. If both players push the rod in the same direction, it spins 60 degrees in that direction. If one player pushes the rod and the other doesn't, it spins 40 degrees in the direction of the push. If neither push, it stays still. If the players push in opposite directions, the rod bends 20 degrees total symmetrically at the center. The rod starts parallel to the x-axis. In rounds 1-5, Player 1's moves are: no push, right, no push, right, left. Player 2 rolls a dice and pushes left if it lands on 5 or a number divisible by 3, otherwise right. His rolls are 2, 6, 5, 3, 5. What's the total absolute (ignoring the direction) angle change at each rod end?

Let's break down the game round by round:

Round 1: Player 1 doesn't push, Player 2 rolls a 2 and pushes right. The rod spins 40 degrees to the right.

Round 2: Player 1 pushes right, Player 2 rolls a 6 (divisible by 3) and pushes left. The rod bends 20 degrees symmetrically at the center. Thus each end spins by 10 degrees. Now player 1’s end of the rod is 50 degrees to the right, and player 2’s end is 30 degrees to the right.

Round 3: Player 1 doesn't push, Player 2 rolls a 5 and pushes left. The rod spins 40 degrees to the left. Now player 1’s end of the rod is 10 degrees to the right, and player 2’s end is 10 degrees to the left.

Round 4: Player 1 pushes right, Player 2 rolls a 3 (divisible by 3) and pushes left. The rod bends 20 degrees symmetrically at the center. Now player 1’s end of the rod is 20 degrees to the right, and player 2’s end is 20 degrees to the left.

Round 5: Player 1 pushes left, Player 2 rolls a 5 and pushes left. The rod spins 60 degrees to the left. Now player 1’s end of the rod is 40 degrees to the left, and player 2’s end is 80 degrees to the left.

So, the total absolute angle change at each rod end is 40 (player 1’s end) + 80 (player 2;s end) = 120 degrees.

The answer is /boxed/120.


A 100m x 100m field has 4 wind blowers at the midpoint of each edge, facing the center. The blowers on opposite sides neutralize each other. There’s an object placed at the field’s center which moves at 2 m/s in the Y direction when the north or south blower is activated and 3m/s in the X direction when the east or west one is activated. At time 0s (s indicating seconds), the north and south blowers are switched on. At 10s, the south blower is turned off and the east one is turned on. At 25s, the north blower is switched off.  At 30s, the east wind blower is switched off and the south one is switched on for a second time. The west blower is activated from 30s to 55s. The south blower is turned off at 70s. What is the object's distance from its starting position at 71s, as a rounded number?

First, let's break down the problem into different time intervals and calculate the displacement of the object in each interval.

1. From 0s to 10s: The north and south blowers are on, so they neutralize each other. The object doesn't move.

2. From 10s to 25s: The south blower is off and the east one is on. The object moves in the X direction at 3m/s for 15s (25s - 10s). So, the displacement in the X direction is 3m/s * 15s = 45m. The north blower is on and effective for 15 seconds as well. The displacement in the Y direction is 2m/s * 15s = 30m

3. From 25s to 30s: The north blower is off. However, the east one is on. The object moves in the X direction at 3m/s for 5s (25s - 10s). So, the displacement in the X direction is 45m + 3m/s * 5s = 60m. At 30s, the east wind blower is switched off and the south one is switched on for a second time.

4. From 30s to 55s: The south and west blowers are on. So the object moves in the X direction at 3m/s for 25s (55s - 30s). So, the displacement in the X direction is 60m - 3m/s * 25s = -15m.

5. From 30s to 70s: The south blower is on, so the object moves in the Y direction at 2m/s for 40s (70s - 30s). So, the displacement in the Y direction is 30m - 2m/s * 40s = -50m (negative because it's in the opposite direction).

6. From 70s to 71s: The south blower is off, so the object doesn't move.

The object's distance from its starting position is the magnitude of its total displacement, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the displacements in the X and Y directions:

Distance = sqrt((-15m)^2 + (-50m)^2) = sqrt(2500 + 225) = sqrt(2755) = 52m.

So, the object's distance from its starting position at 71s is 52m.
